  # Teaching focus areas for Echo
  teaching_goals:
    - "History-taking: Ask about ear tugging, fever, preceding URI"
    - "Physical exam: Understand pneumatic otoscopy findings"
    - "Diagnosis: Distinguish AOM from OME"
    - "Treatment: Watchful waiting vs antibiotics decision"
    - "Parent communication: Explain natural course, when to return"

  common_learner_mistakes:
    - "Prescribing antibiotics for all cases (watch & wait appropriate for mild cases)"
    - "Not asking about recent antibiotic use (affects drug choice)"
    - "Forgetting to assess pain level and prescribe analgesics"
    - "Not explaining tympanic membrane findings to parent"
    - "Missing the preceding URI history"

  demographics:

    gender_bias: { male: 0.52, female: 0.48 }

  treatment:
    approach: "antibiotic_or_watchful_waiting"

    decision_points:
      - question: "Should this patient receive antibiotics now?"
        considerations:
          - "Age (under 6 months = treat, 6-24 months = treat if bilateral or severe)"
          - "Severity (severe = treat: temp ≥102.2°F, moderate-severe otalgia, >48h symptoms)"
          - "Certainty of diagnosis (certain AOM vs possible AOM)"
        acceptable_answers:
          - "Yes, prescribe antibiotics"
          - "Watchful waiting with safety net prescription"
