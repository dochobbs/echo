presentation:
  chief_complaints:
    - "She's been throwing up all day and now has diarrhea"
    - "He can't keep anything down"
    - "She had five diaper blowouts today and looks really tired"
  symptoms:
    - "vomiting"
    - "diarrhea"
    - "abdominal cramps"
    - "low-grade fever"
    - "decreased appetite"
  duration_days: [3, 7]
  physical_exam:
    - { system: "general", finding: "Child appears mildly dehydrated" }
    - { system: "abdomen", finding: "Soft, diffusely tender, hyperactive bowel sounds" }
    - { system: "skin", finding: "Mucous membranes slightly dry, skin turgor normal" }

treatment:
  approach: "Oral rehydration is the cornerstone of treatment"
  medications:
    - agent: "Ondansetron"
      dose_mg_kg: 0.15
      max_dose_mg: 8
      frequency: "x1 dose PRN"
      indication: "To enable oral rehydration in persistent vomiting"
  supportive:
    - "Small frequent sips of Pedialyte (1-2 tsp every 5 minutes)"
    - "Advance diet as tolerated - no BRAT restriction needed"
    - "Breastfeeding should continue"

# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Assess dehydration using clinical signs (cap refill, skin turgor, tears, urine output)"
  - "Calculate oral rehydration volumes (50-100 mL/kg over 4 hours for mild-moderate)"
  - "Know when ondansetron is appropriate (enables ORT, not just for comfort)"
  - "Understand why diet advancement is preferred over restriction"
  - "Recognize red flags suggesting something other than viral gastro"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Ordering stool studies on uncomplicated cases"
  - "Prescribing anti-diarrheal medications (can prolong illness)"
  - "Recommending strict BRAT diet (outdated, nutritionally inadequate)"
  - "Not giving specific rehydration instructions"
  - "Missing signs of moderate-severe dehydration"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Ondansetron single dose reduces vomiting AND reduces ED/clinic revisits"
  - "Breastfed infants should continue nursing - breast milk is rehydrating"
  - "Sugary drinks (juice, soda) worsen diarrhea via osmotic effect"
  - "Rotavirus vaccine has dramatically reduced hospitalizations"
  - "Probiotics may shorten duration by 1 day but aren't required"

red_flags:
  - "Bloody stool (consider bacterial, intussusception)"
  - "Bilious (green) vomiting (consider obstruction)"
  - "Severe abdominal pain (consider surgical causes)"
  - "No urine output >8 hours"
  - "Unable to tolerate any oral fluids"
  - "Altered mental status"

dehydration_assessment:
  mild:
    signs: ["slightly dry mucous membranes", "normal skin turgor", "normal cap refill"]
    treatment: "Oral rehydration at home"
  moderate:
    signs: ["dry mucous membranes", "decreased skin turgor", "cap refill 2-3 seconds"]
    treatment: "Oral rehydration with close observation"
  severe:
    signs: ["very dry membranes", "tenting skin turgor", "cap refill >3 seconds", "lethargy"]
    treatment: "IV fluids required"
