# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Apply age-stratified approach: 8-21 days vs 22-60 days"
  - "Use inflammatory markers (Procalcitonin, ANC, CRP) to stratify risk in older infants"
  - "Know when HSV testing is mandatory"
  - "Understand why urinalysis is the most sensitive screen"
  - "Recognize which infants can be observed at home vs require admission"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Sending home ANY infant 8-21 days old with fever (all need admission)"
  - "Forgetting to consider HSV in infants <21 days"
  - "Not obtaining urine by catheter or suprapubic (bag specimens unreliable)"
  - "Over-relying on 'well-appearing' in very young infants"
  - "Forgetting to ask about maternal history (GBS, HSV, ROM)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "8-21 Days = Automatic Admission. Full sepsis workup + IV antibiotics. Risk too high to miss."
  - "22-60 Days = Use inflammatory markers to stratify. Low-risk may observe at home IF reliable follow-up."
  - "HSV: Test (swabs + blood/CSF PCR) in any infant <21 days or with seizures/vesicles/maternal history."
  - "Urinalysis is the most sensitive screen - negative UA rules out majority of bacterial infections."
  - "Procalcitonin <0.5 ng/mL has high negative predictive value for serious bacterial infection."
  - "WBC count is less useful than procalcitonin and ANC in risk stratification."

red_flags:
  - "Age 8-21 days (automatic high risk)"
  - "Ill-appearing or inconsolable"
  - "Vesicular rash (HSV)"
  - "Seizure activity"
  - "Bulging fontanelle"
  - "Maternal HSV history"
  - "Prematurity <37 weeks"
  - "Temperature >38.5C (101.3F)"

age_stratification:
  early_neonate:
    age_days: [8, 21]
    approach: "Full sepsis workup + Admission + IV antibiotics"
    disposition: "Admit all"
  older_infant:
    age_days: [22, 60]
    approach: "Risk stratify with inflammatory markers"
    low_risk_criteria:
      - "Well-appearing"
      - "No source on exam"
      - "WBC 5,000-15,000"
      - "ANC <4,000"
      - "Procalcitonin <0.5"
      - "UA negative"
    disposition: "Low-risk may observe at home with guaranteed 24h follow-up"
