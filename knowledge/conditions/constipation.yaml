presentation:
  chief_complaints:
    - "He hasn't pooped in 5 days and says his tummy hurts"
    - "She's having accidents at school and I don't understand why"
    - "Every time he tries to go, he screams and holds it in"
    - "There's poop in her underwear but she says she didn't feel it"
  symptoms:
    - "infrequent bowel movements"
    - "hard/painful stools"
    - "abdominal pain"
    - "stool withholding behavior"
    - "fecal soiling (encopresis)"
    - "decreased appetite"
    - "rectal bleeding (fissure)"
  physical_exam:
    - { system: "abdomen", finding: "Soft, nontender or mild LLQ tenderness" }
    - { system: "abdomen", finding: "Palpable stool in LLQ (fecal mass)" }
    - { system: "rectal", finding: "Stool in rectal vault on external inspection", note: "Digital exam usually not needed" }
    - { system: "back", finding: "Normal lumbosacral spine (no dimple/tuft)" }

diagnostics:
  - name: "Abdominal X-ray"
    indication: "NOT routinely needed - clinical diagnosis"
    note: "Consider if uncertain or to show family the fecal burden"

treatment:
  approach: "Disimpaction followed by long-term maintenance; behavior modification"
  disimpaction:
    - agent: "PEG 3350 (Miralax)"
      dose: "1-1.5 g/kg/day"
      max_dose: "100g/day"
      duration: "3-6 days"
      indication: "Oral disimpaction (preferred)"
    - agent: "Glycerin suppository"
      indication: "Infants"
    - agent: "Enema (Fleet or mineral oil)"
      indication: "If oral fails, use cautiously"
  maintenance:
    - agent: "PEG 3350 (Miralax)"
      dose: "0.4-0.8 g/kg/day (start 17g = 1 capful)"
      frequency: "Daily"
      duration: "Months - wean slowly"
      indication: "Long-term softening"
    - agent: "Lactulose"
      dose_ml_kg: 1
      max_dose_ml: 30
      frequency: "Daily to BID"
      indication: "Alternative if PEG not tolerated"
    - agent: "Senna"
      indication: "Add stimulant if osmotic alone insufficient"
      frequency: "Daily or every other day"
  supportive:
    - "Toilet sitting after meals (gastrocolic reflex) x 5-10 min"
    - "Feet flat on floor or stool (squatty potty position)"
    - "Positive reinforcement - reward sitting, NOT producing"
    - "Increase fiber (fruits, vegetables, whole grains)"
    - "Adequate fluids"
    - "Do NOT punish for accidents"

# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Understand the withholding cycle: Pain -> Hold -> Harder stool -> More pain"
  - "Know that maintenance therapy is MONTHS, not days - set expectations"
  - "Recognize that encopresis is overflow incontinence, not behavioral"
  - "Learn to wean Miralax slowly once regular for 2+ months"
  - "Know when red flags warrant further workup (Hirschsprung's, spinal)"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Stopping Miralax too soon (needs months of maintenance)"
  - "Using short bursts of laxatives expecting quick cure"
  - "Blaming child or punishing for encopresis (it's involuntary overflow)"
  - "Ordering unnecessary testing (X-ray, labs) for straightforward cases"
  - "Not addressing behavioral component (toilet time, rewards)"
  - "Recommending fiber alone without adequate softener"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Maintenance: PEG 3350 (Miralax) for MONTHS, not days. Wean slowly."
  - "The Cycle: Pain -> Withholding -> Harder Stool -> More Pain. BREAK the cycle with soft stools."
  - "Encopresis: Overflow incontinence around impacted stool. Child doesn't feel it. NOT behavioral."
  - "Goal: Soft stool EVERY DAY. Titrate Miralax to achieve this. One capful is starting dose, not max."
  - "Weaning: Don't stop abruptly. Decrease by 1/4 capful every 2 weeks after 2+ months of daily soft stools."
  - "Fiber myth: Adding fiber without adequate water and softener makes it worse."

red_flags:
  - "Failure to pass meconium in first 48 hours (Hirschsprung's)"
  - "Onset in first month of life"
  - "Ribbon stools"
  - "Empty rectum with abdominal distension"
  - "Failure to thrive"
  - "Sacral dimple, tuft, or abnormal neurologic exam"
  - "Severe abdominal distension"
  - "Bilious vomiting"

    sample_lines:
      - "Could this be something more serious? Why won't he go?"

  - key: hesitant
    description: "Worried about long-term laxative use"
    sample_lines:
      - "Won't he become dependent on Miralax?"
      - "Can we try prune juice instead?"
      - "I don't want to give him medicine every day."
  - key: frustrated

    sample_lines:
      - "The school keeps calling. She's pooping her pants every day."
      - "He's 6 years old - why can't he control this?"
      - "I've tried everything. Nothing works."
