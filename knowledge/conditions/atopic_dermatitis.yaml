presentation:
  chief_complaints:
    - "She scratches herself all night and can't sleep"
    - "His skin is so dry and red, nothing seems to help"
    - "The rash keeps coming back no matter what we do"
    - "She scratches until she bleeds"
  symptoms:
    - "pruritus (itching)"
    - "dry skin"
    - "erythematous patches"
    - "lichenification"
    - "sleep disturbance"
  physical_exam:
    - { system: "skin", finding: "Erythematous, scaly patches on cheeks and extensor surfaces", age_note: "infants" }
    - { system: "skin", finding: "Lichenified plaques in flexural areas (antecubital, popliteal)", age_note: "older children" }
    - { system: "skin", finding: "Xerosis (generalized dry skin)" }
    - { system: "skin", finding: "Excoriations from scratching" }
    - { system: "skin", finding: "Dennie-Morgan folds under eyes" }

treatment:
  approach: "Soak and seal with emollients; step-up topical steroids for flares"
  supportive:
    - "Daily bathing (lukewarm, 10-15 min) followed immediately by moisturizer"
    - "Soak and Seal: Apply emollient within 3 minutes of bathing while skin still damp"
    - "Fragrance-free moisturizers (Vanicream, CeraVe, Eucerin)"
    - "Avoid triggers: harsh soaps, wool, fragrances"
    - "Keep nails short to minimize excoriation"
  medications:
    - agent: "Hydrocortisone 1%"
      indication: "Face, intertriginous areas - mild"
      frequency: "BID during flares"
    - agent: "Hydrocortisone 2.5%"
      indication: "Face, neck - moderate"
      frequency: "BID during flares"
    - agent: "Triamcinolone 0.1%"
      indication: "Body - moderate flares"
      frequency: "BID x 2 weeks"
    - agent: "Fluocinonide 0.05%"
      indication: "Thick/lichenified areas - severe"
      frequency: "BID x 1-2 weeks (not face)"
    - agent: "Tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1%"
      indication: "Face, steroid-sparing, maintenance"
      frequency: "BID during flares"
    - agent: "Pimecrolimus 1%"
      indication: "Face, mild-moderate, steroid-sparing"
      frequency: "BID during flares"
    - agent: "Hydroxyzine"
      dose_mg_kg: 0.5

# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Master the Soak and Seal technique (bathe -> pat dry -> apply while damp)"
  - "Overcome steroid phobia - explain safety of appropriate topical use"
  - "Know which potency steroids for which body locations"
  - "Recognize when eczema is infected (impetiginization)"
  - "Understand that food allergy rarely CAUSES eczema (don't do elimination diets)"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Under-treating with weak steroids for severe flares (steroid phobia)"
  - "Using high-potency steroids on face/groin (causes atrophy)"
  - "Recommending food elimination diets without evidence of allergy"
  - "Prescribing only PRN instead of consistent moisturizing routine"
  - "Not recognizing secondary bacterial infection (honey crusting = impetigo)"
  - "Forgetting to address sleep disturbance from itching"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Soak and Seal: Bathe 10-15min -> Pat dry -> Apply meds/moisturizer while skin STILL DAMP. This is the cornerstone."
  - "Steroid Phobia: Ointments > Creams. Topical steroids are SAFE; under-treatment is the bigger risk."
  - "Food: Food allergy rarely CAUSES eczema. Avoid elimination diets without clear IgE-mediated reaction."
  - "Ointments > Creams: Ointments occlude better, have fewer preservatives, and are more effective."
  - "Infected eczema: Honey crusting, weeping, rapid worsening = staph superinfection. Add mupirocin or oral antibiotics."
  - "Maintenance: Continue daily moisturizing even when clear. Proactive weekend steroid application prevents flares."

red_flags:
  - "Eczema herpeticum (punched-out erosions, fever) - HSV superinfection"
  - "Widespread impetiginization (honey crusting)"
  - "Failure to respond to appropriate treatment"
  - "Growth failure or systemic symptoms"
  - "Erythroderma (>90% body surface involvement)"

severity_classification:
  mild:
    involvement: "<10% BSA"
    features: "Dry skin, mild erythema, minimal itch"
    treatment: "Moisturizers + low-potency steroids PRN"
  moderate:
    involvement: "10-30% BSA"
    features: "Erythema, papules, excoriations, sleep disturbance"
    treatment: "Moisturizers + medium-potency steroids + consider calcineurin inhibitors"
  severe:
    involvement: ">30% BSA or significant face/hand involvement"
    features: "Lichenification, severe itch, major sleep/QOL impact"
    treatment: "Aggressive topicals, wet wraps, consider systemic therapy referral"
