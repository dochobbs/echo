# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize the classic triad: barking cough, stridor, hoarseness"
  - "Assess severity using the Westley Croup Score"
  - "Understand why steroids work (reduce airway edema)"
  - "Know when to escalate (stridor at rest, hypoxia, drooling)"
  - "Counsel parents that symptoms are typically worse at night"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Ordering a chest X-ray (not needed for classic croup)"
  - "Prescribing antibiotics (viral etiology)"
  - "Using albuterol (doesn't help - different mechanism than asthma)"
  - "Not giving steroids early enough"
  - "Forgetting to warn parents about nighttime worsening"

clinical_pearls:
  - "The 'steeple sign' on X-ray is interesting but imaging is rarely needed"
  - "Racemic epi is for severe cases - requires observation afterward"
  - "A single dose of dex is as effective as multiple doses"
  - "Cold air (opening the freezer, going outside) can temporarily help"
  - "Peak severity is typically days 2-3, not day 1"

red_flags:
  - "Stridor at rest (not just when upset)"
  - "Drooling or difficulty swallowing (consider epiglottitis)"
  - "High fever >104F (atypical for viral croup)"
  - "Toxic appearance"
  - "SpO2 <92%"
