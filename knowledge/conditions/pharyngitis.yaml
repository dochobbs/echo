# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Use Centor/McIsaac criteria to assess strep probability"
  - "Understand when to test vs. treat empirically"
  - "Know why we treat strep (prevent rheumatic fever, not just symptom relief)"
  - "Counsel on return to school (24 hours after antibiotics)"
  - "Recognize signs of peritonsillar abscess"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Prescribing antibiotics before testing (leads to overuse)"
  - "Not testing school-age children with classic symptoms"
  - "Missing the abdominal pain presentation in younger kids"
  - "Forgetting to ask about penicillin allergy"
  - "Not explaining why completing the full course matters"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Cough and rhinorrhea suggest viral cause - strep is less likely"
  - "Scarlet fever is just strep pharyngitis with a rash"
  - "Throat culture backup if rapid is negative but suspicion high"
  - "Once-daily amoxicillin is as effective as divided doses"
  - "Palatal petechiae are suggestive but not pathognomonic for strep"

red_flags:
  - "Unilateral tonsillar swelling (peritonsillar abscess)"
  - "Trismus (difficulty opening mouth)"
  - "Drooling or 'hot potato' voice"
  - "Neck stiffness"
  - "Respiratory distress"

      - "We know the drill - amoxicillin works for us."
      - "How long until he's not contagious?"
  - key: hesitant
    description: "Worried about antibiotic overuse"
    sample_lines:
      - "Do we really need antibiotics? I've heard they're overused."
      - "Can we wait and see if it gets better on its own?"
      - "What about just treating the symptoms?"
  - key: rushed
    description: "Needs to know about school/work"
