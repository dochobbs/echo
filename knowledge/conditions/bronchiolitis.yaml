  chief_complaints:
    - "She's breathing really fast and won't eat"
    - "He has a cold but now he's wheezing"
    - "She seems to be working really hard to breathe"
  symptoms:
    - "wheezing"
    - "tachypnea"
    - "nasal flaring"
    - "retractions"
    - "cough"
    - "rhinorrhea"
    - "poor feeding"
  duration_days: [7, 14]
  physical_exam:
    - { system: "general", finding: "Infant with increased work of breathing" }
    - { system: "respiratory", finding: "Diffuse wheezes and crackles bilaterally" }
    - { system: "respiratory", finding: "Subcostal and intercostal retractions" }
    - { system: "respiratory", finding: "Nasal flaring present" }
    - { system: "heent", finding: "Copious clear rhinorrhea" }

treatment:
  approach: "Supportive care - nasal suctioning and hydration"
  medications: []  # No routine medications
  supportive:
    - "Nasal suctioning before feeds"
    - "Frequent small feeds to maintain hydration"
    - "Supplemental oxygen if SpO2 <90%"

# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Assess work of breathing systematically (RR, retractions, grunting, flaring)"
  - "Understand why bronchodilators don't work (small airway edema, not bronchospasm)"
  - "Calculate appropriate IV fluid rates if needed for dehydration"
  - "Know admission criteria (hypoxia, inability to feed, apnea history)"
  - "Counsel parents on the typical 10-14 day course"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Ordering albuterol trial (not recommended per AAP guidelines)"
  - "Prescribing systemic steroids (no benefit in bronchiolitis)"
  - "Getting a chest X-ray on all patients (leads to unnecessary antibiotics)"
  - "Underestimating feeding difficulty as a marker of severity"
  - "Not asking about prematurity or history of apnea"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Peak symptoms are typically days 3-5, not at presentation"
  - "RSV testing doesn't change management - don't routinely order"
  - "High-flow nasal cannula has changed hospitalization patterns"
  - "Hypertonic saline nebulizers only help inpatients, not outpatients"
  - "Passive antibody (palivizumab) only for high-risk premature infants"

red_flags:
  - "SpO2 <90% on room air"
  - "Severe retractions or grunting"
  - "Apnea episodes"
  - "Poor feeding (<50% of normal intake)"
  - "Prematurity <32 weeks or age <6 weeks"
  - "Underlying heart or lung disease"

    sample_lines:
      - "She's never had trouble breathing before. Is she going to be okay?"

    sample_lines:

    sample_lines:

      - "Can't we just do oxygen at home?"
      - "I'm worried about her catching something else there."

      - "How often do I need to suction her?"
      - "When can she go back to daycare?"
