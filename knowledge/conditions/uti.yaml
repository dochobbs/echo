# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Understand diagnostic criteria: Pyuria AND >50k CFU/mL culture required"
  - "Know proper urine collection methods by age (catheter vs clean catch)"
  - "Apply AAP imaging guidelines: RBUS for all 2-24mo, VCUG only if abnormal or recurrent"
  - "Recognize that bag urine is only useful to RULE OUT (negative has value)"
  - "Identify risk factors for recurrent UTI and VUR"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Diagnosing UTI based on positive UA alone without culture confirmation"
  - "Using bag urine specimens to diagnose (only to rule out)"
  - "Ordering VCUG for all first-time UTIs (only if US abnormal or recurrent)"
  - "Forgetting to ask about constipation (major risk factor)"
  - "Not recognizing that fever without source in infant may be UTI"
  - "Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria (colonization, not infection)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Diagnostic Criteria: Requires Pyuria (WBCs) AND >50k CFU/mL culture. Both needed."
  - "Bag urine is only good for ruling OUT - if negative, UTI very unlikely."
  - "Imaging: RBUS for all febrile infants 2-24mo after first UTI. VCUG only if US abnormal or recurrent."
  - "Constipation causes 40% of recurrent UTIs - always address it."
  - "Uncircumcised males <1 year have 10x higher UTI risk than circumcised."
  - "Fever without source in infant 2-24 months = think UTI, get catheterized specimen."

red_flags:
  - "Toxic appearance"
  - "Unable to tolerate oral fluids"
  - "Age <2 months (manage as febrile infant)"
  - "Known urologic abnormality"
  - "Immunocompromised"
  - "No improvement after 48-72 hours of appropriate antibiotics"

imaging_guidelines:
  first_uti:
    age_2_24_months: "RBUS within 48 hours or after treatment"
    older_child: "Consider RBUS if atypical or recurrent"
  vcug_indications:
    - "Abnormal renal bladder ultrasound"
    - "Recurrent febrile UTI"
    - "Atypical organism"
    - "Poor response to antibiotics"
