presentation:
  chief_complaints:
    - "He was burning up and then his whole body started shaking"
    - "She had a seizure! Her eyes rolled back and she went stiff"
    - "I thought he was dying - he turned blue and wouldn't respond"
    - "She was sick with a fever and then started convulsing"
  symptoms:
    - "generalized tonic-clonic movements"
    - "loss of consciousness"
    - "fever"
    - "postictal drowsiness"
    - "eye deviation"
    - "cyanosis during event"

  physical_exam:
    - { system: "general", finding: "Postictal child, sleepy but arousable", timing: "after seizure" }
    - { system: "neurological", finding: "Back to baseline mental status within 1 hour", timing: "recovered" }
    - { system: "neurological", finding: "Normal neurologic exam at baseline" }
    - { system: "general", finding: "Source of fever identified (viral URI, AOM, roseola)" }

treatment:
  approach: "Supportive care; identify fever source; reassure family"
  acute_management:
    - "Protect airway - position on side"
    - "Do NOT put anything in mouth"
    - "Time the seizure"
    - "Call 911 if >5 minutes"
    - agent: "Midazolam (intranasal/buccal)"
      dose_mg_kg: 0.2
      max_dose_mg: 10
      indication: "If seizure >5 minutes (status epilepticus)"
    - agent: "Diazepam (rectal)"
      dose_mg_kg: 0.5
      max_dose_mg: 20
      indication: "Alternative for prolonged seizure"
  antipyretics:
    - agent: "Acetaminophen"
      dose_mg_kg: 15

      frequency: "Q4-6H PRN"
      indication: "Comfort, NOT seizure prevention"

      max_dose_mg: 400
      frequency: "Q6-8H PRN"
      indication: "Comfort (if >6 months)"
  supportive:
    - "Reassurance - febrile seizures do NOT cause brain damage"
    - "Fever source treatment"
    - "Seizure first aid education"
    - "NO daily anticonvulsant prophylaxis needed"

# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish simple vs complex febrile seizures"
  - "Know that workup is minimal for simple febrile seizure in well-appearing child"
  - "Understand that antipyretics do NOT prevent febrile seizures"
  - "Counsel families on recurrence risk and benign prognosis"
  - "Recognize when LP is needed (age <12mo, complex features, not back to baseline)"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Ordering EEG for simple febrile seizure (not indicated)"
  - "Ordering CT/MRI for simple febrile seizure (not indicated)"
  - "Recommending aggressive antipyretic dosing to prevent recurrence (doesn't work)"
  - "Starting anticonvulsant prophylaxis (reserved for special circumstances only)"
  - "Not reassuring parents about benign nature and excellent prognosis"
  - "Performing LP on all febrile seizures (only if <12mo, complex, or not recovering)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Simple: <15 min, generalized, once in 24h, returns to baseline. NO workup needed in well-appearing child 12-60mo."
  - "Prophylaxis: Antipyretics do NOT prevent febrile seizures. They're for comfort only."
  - "Prognosis: Simple febrile seizures do NOT cause brain damage, epilepsy risk only slightly elevated."
  - "Recurrence: ~30% will have another febrile seizure. Higher if young age, low fever, family history."
  - "LP consideration: Age <12 months, complex features, Hib/Pneumo unvaccinated, on antibiotics, not back to baseline."
  - "Roseola: Classic cause - seizure on day 1 (fever), rash appears day 3-4 when fever breaks."

red_flags:
  - "Duration >15 minutes (complex)"
  - "Focal features (one-sided, eye deviation to one side)"
  - "Multiple seizures in 24 hours"
  - "Not returning to baseline within 1 hour"
  - "Age <6 months or >6 years"
  - "Signs of meningitis (bulging fontanelle, nuchal rigidity)"
  - "Developmental delay at baseline"
  - "Recent head trauma"

classification:
  simple:
    duration: "<15 minutes"
    type: "Generalized"
    occurrence: "Single in 24 hours"
    recovery: "Returns to baseline quickly"
    workup: "Minimal - find fever source only"
    prognosis: "Excellent"
  complex:
    features:
      - "Duration >15 minutes"
      - "Focal features"
      - ">1 seizure in 24 hours"
      - "Prolonged postictal period"
    workup: "Consider LP, neuroimaging, EEG based on features"
    followup: "Neurology referral"

recurrence_risk:
  overall: "30-35%"
  risk_factors:
    - "Age <18 months at first seizure"
    - "Low grade fever at time of seizure"
    - "Short duration of fever before seizure"
    - "Family history of febrile seizures"
  with_0_risk_factors: "~15%"
  with_4_risk_factors: "~70%"
