treatment:
  approach: "Step-wise therapy based on severity classification; SMART therapy for moderate-severe"
  acute_exacerbation:
    - agent: "Albuterol"
      dose: "4-8 puffs MDI with spacer OR 2.5mg nebulized"
      frequency: "Q20min x 3, then Q1-4H as needed"
      indication: "Acute bronchodilation"
    - agent: "Ipratropium"
      dose: "4-8 puffs MDI OR 0.5mg nebulized"
      frequency: "Q20min x 3 doses"
      indication: "Add in moderate-severe exacerbation"
    - agent: "Prednisone/Prednisolone"
      dose_mg_kg: 2
      max_dose_mg: 60
      frequency: "Daily x 3-5 days"
      indication: "Systemic inflammation control"
    - agent: "Dexamethasone"
      dose_mg_kg: 0.6
      max_dose_mg: 16
      frequency: "Daily x 1-2 days"
      indication: "Alternative to prednisone (better compliance)"
  controller_medications:
    - agent: "Fluticasone (low dose ICS)"
      dose: "44-88 mcg BID"
      indication: "Step 2 - mild persistent"
    - agent: "Fluticasone-Salmeterol (ICS-LABA)"
      dose: "100/50 mcg BID"
      indication: "Step 3-4 - moderate persistent"
    - agent: "Budesonide-Formoterol (SMART therapy)"
      dose: "80/4.5 mcg"
      indication: "Controller AND reliever for moderate-severe"
    - agent: "Montelukast"
      dose: "4mg (2-5y), 5mg (6-14y), 10mg (>15y)"
      frequency: "Daily"
      indication: "Add-on therapy, exercise-induced, or allergic component"

# ============= TEACHING ENHANCEMENTS =============

teaching_goals:
  - "Apply the Rule of Twos to classify persistent vs intermittent asthma"
  - "Understand SMART therapy (ICS-Formoterol as controller AND reliever)"
  - "Know that MDI with spacer is as effective as nebulizer for acute flares"
  - "Recognize undertreated asthma (night symptoms, activity limitation)"
  - "Create and review Asthma Action Plans with families"

common_learner_mistakes:
  - "Prescribing albuterol alone without assessing need for controller"
  - "Not using spacers with MDIs (reduces lung deposition significantly)"
  - "Forgetting to assess inhaler technique at every visit"
  - "Over-relying on nebulizers when MDI+spacer equally effective"
  - "Not stepping down therapy when well-controlled for 3+ months"
  - "Prescribing oral steroids repeatedly without optimizing controller"

clinical_pearls:
  - "SMART Therapy: ICS-Formoterol (Symbicort) as BOTH controller AND reliever is superior to albuterol alone for moderate-severe."
  - "Rule of Twos: Symptoms >2x/week OR Night awakening >2x/month = Persistent Asthma = Needs Controller."
  - "Spacers: MDIs with spacers are AS EFFECTIVE as nebulizers for acute flares. Easier, faster."
  - "Technique matters: 80% of patients use inhalers incorrectly. Check at every visit."
  - "Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg x 1-2 days = Prednisone x 5 days for exacerbations."
  - "Eczema + Allergic rhinitis + Family history = High probability of asthma (atopic triad)."

red_flags:
  - "SpO2 <92% on room air"
  - "Unable to speak in sentences"
  - "Severe retractions or nasal flaring"
  - "Silent chest (no air movement)"
  - "Altered mental status"
  - "Previous ICU admission or intubation"
  - "Using accessory muscles"
