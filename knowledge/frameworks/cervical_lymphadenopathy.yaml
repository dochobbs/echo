# Cervical Lymphadenopathy - Teaching Framework
topic: "Cervical Lymphadenopathy"
aliases: ["swollen lymph nodes", "neck mass", "lymphadenitis"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish reactive from concerning lymphadenopathy"
  - "Recognize bacterial lymphadenitis"
  - "Know red flags for malignancy"
  - "Choose appropriate antibiotic coverage"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing supraclavicular nodes (always pathologic)"
  - "Undertreating bacterial lymphadenitis"
  - "Over-imaging reactive lymphadenopathy"
  - "Not following up persistent nodes"

red_flags:
  - "Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (malignancy)"
  - "Fixed, non-tender, hard nodes"
  - "Rapidly enlarging nodes"
  - "Associated weight loss, night sweats"
  - "Generalized lymphadenopathy"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Reactive: Small, mobile, bilateral = Viral, reassure"
  - "Lymphadenitis: Unilateral, tender, red, >2-3cm = Bacterial (Staph/Strep)"
  - "Bacterial lymphadenitis: Clindamycin covers both Staph and Strep"
  - "SUPRACLAVICULAR nodes are ALWAYS PATHOLOGIC - think malignancy"

key_history_questions:
  - "How long has the swelling been present?"
  - "Any recent illness, dental problems, or injury?"
  - "Pain or tenderness?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Weight loss, night sweats?"
  - "Cat exposure (cat scratch disease)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Location of nodes"
  - "Size (measure in cm)"
  - "Unilateral vs bilateral"
  - "Tenderness"
  - "Mobility vs fixed"
  - "Overlying skin changes (erythema, warmth)"
  - "Generalized vs localized"

treatment_principles:
  - "Reactive: Observation, reassurance"
  - "Bacterial lymphadenitis: Clindamycin 30-40 mg/kg/day divided TID"
  - "Fluctuant nodes: May need I&D"
  - "Persistent unexplained: Consider biopsy"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases, with follow-up"
  - "Urgent workup: Supraclavicular, fixed hard nodes, systemic symptoms"
  - "Follow-up: Recheck in 2-4 weeks if observation"

differential_diagnosis:
  - "Reactive lymphadenopathy (viral)"
  - "Bacterial lymphadenitis"
  - "Cat scratch disease"
  - "Mycobacterial infection"
  - "Malignancy (lymphoma, leukemia)"

parent_styles: [worried-about-cancer, reassurance-seeking, persistent-concern]
