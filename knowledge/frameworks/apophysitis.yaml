# Apophysitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Apophysitis"
aliases: ["Osgood-Schlatter", "Sever's disease", "apophysitis", "growing pains"]
category: msk
age_range_months: [96, 192]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize common apophysitis syndromes by location and age"
  - "Know these are self-limited overuse injuries"
  - "Understand imaging is not needed for typical presentation"
  - "Counsel on activity modification and timeline"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering X-rays for classic presentation"
  - "Restricting all activity (relative rest, not immobilization)"
  - "Missing underlying pathology when presentation atypical"
  - "Not addressing training errors"

red_flags:
  - "Night pain, rest pain"
  - "Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss)"
  - "Progressive swelling or mass"
  - "Locked knee or inability to bear weight"
  - "Point tenderness over bone (not apophysis)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Osgood-Schlatter: Tibial tubercle pain in active 10-15 year olds"
  - "Sever's disease (calcaneal apophysitis): Heel pain in 8-14 year olds"
  - "Little League elbow (medial epicondyle apophysitis): Throwing athletes"
  - "Treatment: RELATIVE rest, ice, NSAIDs, stretching - resolves with skeletal maturity"
  - "X-rays not needed for typical presentation - may show normal apophyseal changes"

key_history_questions:
  - "Location of pain? When did it start?"
  - "What sport/activity? How often? Recent increase?"
  - "Pain with activity or at rest?"
  - "Any swelling?"
  - "Any recent growth spurt?"
  - "Any night pain or systemic symptoms?"
  - "What makes it better or worse?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Point tenderness at specific apophysis"
  - "Osgood-Schlatter: Tibial tubercle prominence, tender"
  - "Sever's: Squeeze test positive at calcaneus"
  - "Swelling may be present"
  - "No joint effusion (if present, consider other diagnosis)"
  - "Full ROM typically (may have pain at extremes)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Relative rest: Decrease activity intensity, not complete rest"
  - "Ice after activity"
  - "NSAIDs for pain"
  - "Stretching: Quadriceps (Osgood), gastrocnemius/soleus (Sever)"
  - "Heel cups for Sever's disease"
  - "Infrapatellar strap for Osgood-Schlatter"
  - "Resolves with skeletal maturity (closure of growth plate)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All typical cases"
  - "X-ray: Only if atypical (acute trauma, night pain, systemic symptoms)"
  - "Physical therapy: If severe or not improving"
  - "Orthopedics: Atypical presentation, not improving, suspected other pathology"
  - "Counsel: Will resolve with growth - may take 12-24 months"
