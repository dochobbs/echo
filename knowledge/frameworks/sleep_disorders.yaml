# Pediatric Sleep Disorders - Teaching Framework
topic: "Pediatric Sleep Disorders"
aliases: ["insomnia", "sleep problems", "behavioral insomnia", "night terrors", "sleepwalking"]
category: behavioral
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize behavioral insomnia of childhood"
  - "Distinguish parasomnias from seizures"
  - "Counsel on sleep hygiene"
  - "Know when sleep study is indicated"

common_mistakes:
  - "Recommending melatonin before addressing sleep hygiene"
  - "Not asking about snoring (OSA)"
  - "Missing delayed sleep phase in adolescents"
  - "Confusing night terrors with nightmares"

red_flags:
  - "Snoring + apneas + daytime sleepiness (OSA)"
  - "Excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate sleep"
  - "Parasomnia with injury, stereotyped movements, or daily occurrence (seizure?)"
  - "Cataplexy (narcolepsy)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Sleep needs by age: Infants 12-16h, Toddlers 11-14h, Preschool 10-13h, School-age 9-12h, Teens 8-10h"
  - "Behavioral insomnia: Sleep-onset association type vs limit-setting type"
  - "Night terrors: Early night, no memory, hard to wake - reassurance, safety"
  - "Adolescent delayed sleep phase: Normal biology - can't fall asleep until late, can't wake for school"
  - "Melatonin: Low dose (0.5-1mg) 1-2 hours before target bedtime for sleep onset"

key_history_questions:
  - "Bedtime routine? How long to fall asleep?"
  - "Where does child sleep? With whom?"
  - "Night wakings? What happens?"
  - "Wake time? Daytime sleepiness?"
  - "Snoring? Gasping? Mouth breathing?"
  - "Parasomnias (sleepwalking, terrors, talking)?"
  - "Screen time before bed?"
  - "Caffeine intake?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Adenotonsillar hypertrophy"
  - "Allergic facies, mouth breathing"
  - "Weight (obesity increases OSA risk)"
  - "Signs of sleep deprivation"
  - "Developmental assessment (sleep affects learning)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Sleep hygiene first: Consistent schedule, dark/cool/quiet room, no screens before bed"
  - "Behavioral insomnia: Extinction methods (graduated or unmodified)"
  - "Night terrors: Safety measures, scheduled awakenings if predictable"
  - "Delayed phase: Light exposure in morning, melatonin in evening"
  - "OSA: Adenotonsillectomy if enlarged adenoids/tonsils"
  - "Melatonin: Adjunct only after behavioral interventions"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most behavioral sleep issues"
  - "ENT: Significant adenotonsillar hypertrophy, suspected OSA"
  - "Sleep study: Suspected OSA, narcolepsy, concerning parasomnia"
  - "Neurology: Seizure concern, narcolepsy"

parent_styles: [exhausted, co-sleeping-committed, wants-quick-fix, anxious]
