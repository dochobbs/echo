# Hematuria and Proteinuria - Teaching Framework
topic: "Hematuria and Proteinuria"
aliases: ["hematuria", "proteinuria", "blood in urine", "protein in urine"]
category: nephrology
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish microscopic from gross hematuria workup"
  - "Know orthostatic proteinuria is benign"
  - "Recognize glomerulonephritis vs UTI presentation"
  - "Understand when to refer to nephrology"

common_mistakes:
  - "Extensive workup for single episode microscopic hematuria"
  - "Missing orthostatic proteinuria (need first morning urine)"
  - "Not confirming hematuria with microscopy"
  - "Missing signs of glomerulonephritis"

red_flags:
  - "Gross hematuria with RBC casts, proteinuria (glomerulonephritis)"
  - "Hypertension with hematuria"
  - "Edema, oliguria"
  - "Recent pharyngitis or impetigo (post-strep GN)"
  - "Family history of kidney disease or hearing loss (Alport)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Confirm hematuria: Dipstick positive → must have RBCs on microscopy"
  - "False positive dipstick: Hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, medications"
  - "Orthostatic proteinuria: Protein in afternoon urine, ABSENT in first morning urine - benign"
  - "Glomerular hematuria: RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs, proteinuria"
  - "Post-strep GN: 1-2 weeks after pharyngitis or 3-6 weeks after impetigo"

key_history_questions:
  - "Color of urine? (Gross hematuria = tea/cola colored)"
  - "Any recent pharyngitis or skin infection?"
  - "Dysuria, frequency, fever? (UTI)"
  - "Recent trauma?"
  - "Family history of kidney disease, dialysis, hearing loss?"
  - "Edema, decreased urine output?"
  - "Recent strenuous exercise?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Blood pressure"
  - "Edema (periorbital, peripheral)"
  - "Abdominal/flank masses"
  - "Rashes (HSP, SLE)"
  - "Throat, skin (recent infection)"
  - "Signs of systemic disease"

treatment_principles:
  - "Isolated microscopic hematuria: Repeat UA in 1-2 weeks; if persistent, workup"
  - "Orthostatic proteinuria: First morning urine protein/creatinine ratio - if normal, benign"
  - "Post-strep GN: Supportive - BP control, fluid/salt restriction; resolves in weeks"
  - "Glomerulonephritis: Nephrology referral, may need biopsy"
  - "Significant proteinuria (>0.2 protein/creat ratio on first morning): Nephrology"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Repeat UA: Single episode microscopic hematuria"
  - "Labs: BMP, C3/C4, ASO/anti-DNase B (if post-strep suspected)"
  - "First morning urine: Protein/creatinine ratio (orthostatic proteinuria)"
  - "Nephrology referral: Persistent hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, renal dysfunction"
  - "Urgent: Gross hematuria with hypertension, edema, oliguria"
