# Periorbital vs Orbital Cellulitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Periorbital & Orbital Cellulitis"
aliases: ["preseptal cellulitis", "orbital cellulitis", "eye infection"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish periorbital from orbital cellulitis"
  - "Know red flags requiring imaging and admission"
  - "Understand this can be sight and life-threatening"
  - "Order appropriate imaging when indicated"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing orbital involvement"
  - "Not ordering CT when orbital signs present"
  - "Treating orbital cellulitis as outpatient"
  - "Assuming all periorbital swelling is cellulitis (consider other causes)"

red_flags:
  - "Pain with eye movement (ophthalmoplegia)"
  - "Proptosis"
  - "Diplopia"
  - "Decreased visual acuity"
  - "Fever with eye findings"

clinical_pearls:
  - "PERIORBITAL (preseptal): Eyelid swelling ONLY, normal eye movements"
  - "ORBITAL (postseptal): Pain with movement, Proptosis, Diplopia - involves EOM"
  - "Contrast CT required if ANY sign of orbital involvement"
  - "Orbital cellulitis = Emergency admission + IV antibiotics"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of swelling?"
  - "Any recent sinus infection or URI?"
  - "Trauma or insect bite to area?"
  - "Pain - at rest or with eye movement?"
  - "Double vision?"
  - "Fever?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Eyelid edema and erythema"
  - "Extraocular movements (CRITICAL)"
  - "Proptosis assessment"
  - "Visual acuity"
  - "Pupillary response"
  - "Chemosis"
  - "Eye pain with movement"

treatment_principles:
  - "Periorbital: Oral antibiotics (Augmentin), close follow-up"
  - "Orbital: IV antibiotics (Vanc + Ceftriaxone or Unasyn)"
  - "Orbital: ENT and Ophthalmology consults"
  - "May need surgical drainage if abscess present"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Periorbital only, mild, reliable follow-up"
  - "Admit: ANY orbital signs, severe periorbital, not improving"
  - "Emergent CT: Pain with eye movement, proptosis, diplopia"

differential_diagnosis:
  - "Allergic reaction"
  - "Insect bite"
  - "Chalazion/hordeolum"
  - "Dacryocystitis"

parent_styles: [scared-about-vision, wants-antibiotics, delayed-presentation]
