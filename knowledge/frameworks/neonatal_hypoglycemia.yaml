# Neonatal Hypoglycemia - Teaching Framework
topic: "Neonatal Hypoglycemia"
aliases: ["newborn hypoglycemia", "low blood sugar newborn"]
category: newborn
age_range_months: [0, 1]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize symptomatic hypoglycemia requires immediate treatment"
  - "Know target glucose thresholds"
  - "Use dextrose gel as first-line intervention"
  - "Identify at-risk infants for screening"

common_mistakes:
  - "Waiting for lab confirmation in symptomatic infant"
  - "Not using dextrose gel before escalating to IV"
  - "Failing to identify high-risk infants for screening"
  - "Using incorrect glucose thresholds"

red_flags:
  - "Symptomatic hypoglycemia (jitteriness, lethargy, seizures)"
  - "Glucose <25 mg/dL"
  - "Persistent hypoglycemia despite feeding"
  - "Large for gestational age or infant of diabetic mother"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Symptomatic (jitteriness/lethargy) = immediate treatment regardless of number"
  - "Target glucose >45 mg/dL in first 24 hours"
  - "40% Dextrose Gel (buccal) is FIRST-LINE to prevent NICU admission"
  - "High-risk screening: IDM, LGA, SGA, late preterm"

key_history_questions:
  - "Maternal diabetes (gestational or preexisting)?"
  - "Birth weight - large or small for gestational age?"
  - "Gestational age - late preterm?"
  - "Time of last feed?"
  - "Any symptoms (jitteriness, poor feeding, lethargy)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Jitteriness"
  - "Lethargy or hypotonia"
  - "Poor feeding"
  - "Tremors"
  - "Seizure activity"
  - "Temperature instability"

treatment_principles:
  - "Dextrose gel 40% (0.5 mL/kg) buccal - first line"
  - "Feed immediately after gel"
  - "Recheck glucose 30 minutes after intervention"
  - "IV dextrose if gel fails or severe/symptomatic"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Routine care: Normal glucose, low-risk infant"
  - "Close monitoring: High-risk infant, normal initial glucose"
  - "NICU: Persistent hypoglycemia, symptomatic, failed gel treatment"

parent_styles: [worried, diabetic-mother-guilt, first-time]
