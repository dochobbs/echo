# Gastroesophageal Reflux - Teaching Framework
topic: "Gastroesophageal Reflux"
aliases: ["GER", "GERD", "reflux", "spitting up"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [0, 24]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish physiologic GER from pathologic GERD"
  - "Know 'happy spitter' needs no treatment"
  - "Avoid routine acid suppression for uncomplicated reflux"
  - "Recognize when workup is needed"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating normal infant spit-up with PPIs"
  - "Not addressing overfeeding"
  - "Missing cow's milk protein intolerance"
  - "Ordering imaging for typical presentation"

red_flags:
  - "Bilious vomiting (malrotation)"
  - "Projectile vomiting (pyloric stenosis)"
  - "Poor weight gain, failure to thrive"
  - "Hematemesis"
  - "Respiratory symptoms (apnea, recurrent pneumonia)"
  - "Sandifer syndrome (arching, torticollis)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "GER (physiologic): Spitting up in happy, growing infant - peaks at 4 months, resolves by 12-18 months"
  - "GERD (pathologic): Complications - poor growth, esophagitis, respiratory issues"
  - "'Happy spitter' = NO treatment needed, just reassurance"
  - "Avoid PPIs in infants without proven GERD - no benefit, potential harms"
  - "Consider CMPI if persistent symptoms or blood in stool"

key_history_questions:
  - "Frequency and volume of spit-up?"
  - "Forceful/projectile? Bilious?"
  - "Feeding amount and frequency (overfeeding?)"
  - "Any blood in spit-up?"
  - "Weight gain? Following curve?"
  - "Fussiness, arching, feeding refusal?"
  - "Any respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze, apnea)?"
  - "Formula type? Any changes?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Weight and growth trajectory"
  - "Hydration status"
  - "Abdominal exam (olive mass = pyloric stenosis)"
  - "Signs of respiratory distress"
  - "Generally normal in physiologic GER"

treatment_principles:
  - "Physiologic GER: Reassurance, feeding modifications"
  - "Feeding adjustments: Smaller, more frequent feeds; upright positioning after feeds"
  - "If formula-fed: Can trial thickened feeds (rice cereal)"
  - "If breastfed: Continue - may try maternal dairy elimination if CMPI suspected"
  - "Acid suppression (PPI): Only for proven GERD with complications"
  - "Avoid: Positional devices, prone sleeping (SIDS risk)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "GI referral: Failed conservative management, suspicion for GERD complications"
  - "Urgent: Bilious vomiting, projectile vomiting, FTT, significant respiratory symptoms"
  - "No imaging needed for typical GER"

parent_styles: [wants-medication, exhausted, over-feeding, anxious]
