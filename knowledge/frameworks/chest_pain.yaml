# Pediatric Chest Pain - Teaching Framework
topic: "Pediatric Chest Pain"
aliases: ["chest pain", "chest discomfort"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [48, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize that cardiac causes are RARE in children"
  - "Know the common benign causes"
  - "Identify true red flags requiring cardiac workup"
  - "Avoid unnecessary testing in typical presentations"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering ECG/echo for all chest pain (low yield)"
  - "Missing musculoskeletal causes (most common)"
  - "Not addressing anxiety as a cause"
  - "Over-testing leading to more anxiety"

red_flags:
  - "Exertional chest pain (with exercise)"
  - "Syncope or near-syncope with chest pain"
  - "Palpitations"
  - "Family history of sudden cardiac death, cardiomyopathy, Long QT"
  - "History of Kawasaki, heart disease, or chest surgery"
  - "Abnormal exam (murmur, irregular rhythm, abnormal BP)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Chest pain in children is almost NEVER cardiac - musculoskeletal/idiopathic most common"
  - "Musculoskeletal: Reproducible with palpation - NO further workup"
  - "Costochondritis: Tender at costochondral junctions, often unilateral"
  - "Cardiac workup only if: Exertional, syncope, palpitations, FH sudden death, abnormal exam"
  - "Anxiety is common cause - especially with hyperventilation, associated stress"

key_history_questions:
  - "Sharp or dull? Where exactly?"
  - "Associated with exercise? Rest?"
  - "How long does it last? Frequency?"
  - "Any palpitations? Racing heart?"
  - "Any dizziness, syncope, near-fainting?"
  - "Recent illness, trauma, heavy lifting, coughing?"
  - "Anxiety, stress, life changes?"
  - "Family history of heart disease, sudden death, cardiomyopathy?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Vital signs including blood pressure in both arms"
  - "Cardiac: Rate, rhythm, murmurs"
  - "Chest wall: Reproducible tenderness (costochondritis = MSK cause)"
  - "Respiratory: Breath sounds, wheezing"
  - "Signs of anxiety"
  - "Red flags: Abnormal vitals, murmur, hepatomegaly"

treatment_principles:
  - "Musculoskeletal (most common): NSAIDs, reassurance"
  - "Costochondritis: NSAIDs, may last weeks"
  - "Anxiety-related: Breathing exercises, reassurance, address underlying anxiety"
  - "GERD: Trial of antacid if suspected"
  - "Cardiac workup (ECG, echo) ONLY if red flags present"
  - "Most: Reassurance is the treatment"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "Cardiology: If red flags present (exertional, syncope, palpitations, FH, abnormal exam)"
  - "ED: Acute severe chest pain, respiratory distress, abnormal vitals"
  - "Follow-up: As needed based on diagnosis"
  - "Reassure: Cardiac causes rare in pediatric chest pain"
