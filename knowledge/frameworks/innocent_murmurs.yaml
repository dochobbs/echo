# Innocent Heart Murmurs - Teaching Framework
topic: "Innocent Heart Murmurs"
aliases: ["functional murmur", "benign murmur", "Still's murmur", "physiologic murmur"]
category: cardiovascular
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize characteristics of innocent murmurs"
  - "Distinguish innocent from pathologic murmurs"
  - "Know when referral to cardiology is needed"
  - "Counsel families appropriately"
  - "Understand types: Still's, venous hum, pulmonary flow"

common_mistakes:
  - "Referring every murmur to cardiology"
  - "Obtaining unnecessary echocardiograms"
  - "Missing red flags suggesting pathology"
  - "Inadequate parental counseling causing anxiety"
  - "Not examining in multiple positions"

red_flags:
  - "Diastolic murmur"
  - "Grade 3+ holosystolic murmur"
  - "Harsh or blowing quality"
  - "Associated symptoms (syncope, chest pain, dyspnea)"
  - "Abnormal pulses or blood pressure"
  - "Failure to thrive"
  - "Cyanosis or poor perfusion"
  - "Family history of sudden cardiac death"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Still's murmur: musical, vibratory, grade 1-2, LLSB, louder supine"
  - "Venous hum: continuous, disappears when supine or with neck turning"
  - "Pulmonary flow murmur: soft systolic at LUSB, common in thin children"
  - "Innocent murmurs are ALWAYS systolic (except venous hum)"
  - "Change with position - pathologic murmurs typically don't"
  - "50-90% of children have an audible murmur at some point"
  - "Fever, anemia, anxiety increase intensity of innocent murmurs"

key_history_questions:
  - "Any symptoms: chest pain, palpitations, syncope, exercise intolerance?"
  - "Blue spells or shortness of breath?"
  - "Failure to thrive or feeding difficulties (infants)?"
  - "Family history of congenital heart disease or sudden death?"
  - "When was murmur first noted?"
  - "Recent illness or fever?"
  - "Activity level compared to peers?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Murmur characteristics: timing, location, grade, radiation, quality"
  - "Change with position (supine vs sitting vs standing)"
  - "Peripheral pulses (femoral, brachial)"
  - "Blood pressure in arms"
  - "Hepatomegaly"
  - "Signs of heart failure"
  - "Growth parameters"

treatment_principles:
  - "Reassurance for classic innocent murmur"
  - "No activity restrictions needed"
  - "No endocarditis prophylaxis required"
  - "Re-examine if febrile or symptomatic"
  - "Document murmur characteristics for future comparison"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Classic innocent murmur with no red flags"
  - "Cardiology referral: Diastolic murmur, symptoms, abnormal pulses, FTT"
  - "Echo indicated: Pathologic features, symptomatic, family history"
  - "Follow-up: Routine well visits, re-examine if symptomatic"

parent_styles: [anxious, reassurance-seeking, family-history-concerned]
