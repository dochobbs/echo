# Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease - Teaching Framework
topic: "Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease"
aliases: ["HFMD", "coxsackie", "enterovirus"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [6, 60]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic distribution of lesions"
  - "Understand it's a clinical diagnosis"
  - "Know when to worry about dehydration"
  - "Counsel on pain management and oral intake"
  - "Understand atypical presentations"

common_mistakes:
  - "Prescribing antibiotics"
  - "Confusing with HSV gingivostomatitis"
  - "Not addressing dehydration risk"
  - "Excessive daycare exclusion"
  - "Missing atypical presentations (widespread rash)"

red_flags:
  - "Severe dehydration"
  - "Neurological symptoms (rare EV71 complication)"
  - "High persistent fever > 3 days"
  - "Lethargy or irritability out of proportion"
  - "Nail changes weeks later (onychomadesis - benign)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic triad: oral ulcers, palmar/plantar vesicles, +/- buttock lesions"
  - "Oral lesions most painful - cause poor intake"
  - "Self-limited: 7-10 days"
  - "Most contagious in first week"
  - "Atypical HFMD: widespread vesicles, can mimic chickenpox"
  - "Coxsackie A6 causes more extensive rash"
  - "Onychomadesis (nail shedding) can occur weeks later - benign"

key_history_questions:
  - "Fever history?"
  - "Oral intake - any signs of dehydration?"
  - "Rash distribution?"
  - "Sick contacts or daycare outbreak?"
  - "Prior HFMD (can recur with different serotypes)?"
  - "Pain with eating?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Oral ulcers (tongue, buccal mucosa, palate)"
  - "Vesicles on hands (palms, fingers)"
  - "Vesicles on feet (soles)"
  - "Buttock or knee involvement"
  - "Hydration status"
  - "General appearance"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care only"
  - "Pain control: acetaminophen, ibuprofen"
  - "Magic mouthwash for oral pain if needed"
  - "Cold foods and fluids for comfort"
  - "Monitor for dehydration"
  - "No antibiotics or antivirals"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Nearly all cases"
  - "Urgent evaluation: Signs of dehydration, neurological symptoms"
  - "Daycare: Can return when fever-free, lesions not necessarily crusted"
  - "Follow-up: If worsening or poor oral intake"

parent_styles: [anxious, daycare-policy-focused, experienced]
