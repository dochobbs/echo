# Scoliosis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Scoliosis"
aliases: ["scoliosis", "spinal curvature", "idiopathic scoliosis"]
category: msk
age_range_months: [96, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Screen with forward bend test at well visits"
  - "Know when to refer vs observe"
  - "Understand idiopathic vs concerning causes"
  - "Counsel on natural history and treatment options"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not screening at appropriate ages (10-16)"
  - "Missing atypical features (pain, neurologic symptoms) suggesting other cause"
  - "Over-referring minor curves that need only observation"
  - "Recommending unproven treatments (chiropractic, bracing for minor curves)"

red_flags:
  - "Pain with scoliosis (not typical of idiopathic)"
  - "Rapid progression"
  - "Neurologic symptoms or exam findings"
  - "Younger age at onset (<10 years)"
  - "Left thoracic curve (more likely pathologic)"
  - "Associated syndromes or stigmata"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: Most common, girls > boys, painless"
  - "Forward bend test (Adam's test): Rib hump or lumbar prominence indicates rotation"
  - "Scoliometer: >5-7° asymmetry warrants X-ray"
  - "Cobb angle on X-ray: <25° observe, 25-40° brace, >40-50° consider surgery"
  - "Bracing: Effective if skeletally immature and curve 25-40°"

key_history_questions:
  - "Who first noticed the curve? When?"
  - "Any back pain? (Atypical for idiopathic)"
  - "Any neurologic symptoms (weakness, numbness, bowel/bladder)?"
  - "Menarchal status? (Remaining growth determines treatment)"
  - "Family history of scoliosis?"
  - "Any other medical conditions or syndromes?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Forward bend test - look for rib hump or lumbar prominence"
  - "Shoulder height asymmetry"
  - "Waist asymmetry, scapular prominence"
  - "Leg length discrepancy"
  - "Neurologic exam (should be normal in idiopathic)"
  - "Skin exam (café-au-lait spots = NF, midline lesions = spinal dysraphism)"
  - "Scoliometer measurement if available"

treatment_principles:
  - "Mild (<25°): Observation with serial exams/X-rays during growth"
  - "Moderate (25-40°): Bracing if skeletally immature (Risser 0-2)"
  - "Severe (>40-50°): Surgical consultation"
  - "Bracing: Must be worn 16-23 hours/day to be effective"
  - "Physical therapy: May help with pain, not proven to change curve"
  - "No evidence for chiropractic, electrical stimulation"

disposition_guidance:
  - "X-ray: If scoliometer >5-7° or visible asymmetry on exam"
  - "Observe: Cobb <25°, skeletally immature - recheck in 6 months"
  - "Orthopedics referral: Cobb >25°, rapid progression, skeletal immaturity"
  - "Urgent: Neurologic symptoms, significant pain, rapidly progressive"
  - "Screen: Well-child visits ages 10-16"
