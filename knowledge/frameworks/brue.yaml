# BRUE - Teaching Framework
topic: "Brief Resolved Unexplained Event"
aliases: ["BRUE", "ALTE", "apparent life-threatening event"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [0, 12]

teaching_goals:
  - "Apply AAP BRUE criteria correctly"
  - "Risk stratify low vs higher risk"
  - "Know appropriate workup by risk level"
  - "Understand BRUE replaced ALTE terminology"
  - "Counsel families on prognosis and monitoring"

common_mistakes:
  - "Extensive workup for low-risk BRUE"
  - "Missing higher-risk features"
  - "Confusing BRUE with explained events"
  - "Not observing for adequate period"
  - "Discharging without appropriate follow-up"

red_flags:
  - "Age < 60 days (higher risk)"
  - "Prematurity < 32 weeks or corrected age < 45 weeks"
  - "Event duration > 1 minute"
  - "Required CPR by trained provider"
  - "Multiple events"
  - "Concerning history features (abuse, toxic exposure)"
  - "Abnormal physical exam"

clinical_pearls:
  - "BRUE = Brief, Resolved, Unexplained, Event"
  - "Replaces ALTE (apparent life-threatening event)"
  - "Must be < 1 year old"
  - "Event must be resolved by time of evaluation"
  - "Low-risk: >60 days, no prematurity, first event, <1 min, no CPR needed"
  - "Low-risk BRUE: no testing required, observe 1-4 hours"
  - "Higher-risk: more extensive evaluation indicated"
  - "Most low-risk BRUEs do not recur and have excellent outcomes"

key_history_questions:
  - "Describe exactly what happened"
  - "How long did the episode last?"
  - "Color change - what color?"
  - "Breathing - stopped, labored, irregular?"
  - "Muscle tone - stiff, limp, shaking?"
  - "Responsiveness during event?"
  - "What did you do? Did you need to stimulate or do CPR?"
  - "Completely back to normal now?"
  - "Any similar events before?"
  - "Feeding history, choking, or reflux?"
  - "Prematurity? Gestational age?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Complete physical exam must be normal for BRUE diagnosis"
  - "Vital signs including oxygen saturation"
  - "Mental status and tone"
  - "Signs of infection"
  - "Signs of trauma (NAT)"
  - "Dysmorphic features"
  - "Cardiac exam"
  - "Respiratory exam"

treatment_principles:
  - "Low-risk BRUE: observation, no mandatory testing"
  - "Low-risk: may consider pertussis testing, ECG (not required)"
  - "Education on CPR and safe sleep"
  - "DO NOT order: labs, imaging, EEG for low-risk"
  - "Higher-risk: workup based on clinical suspicion"
  - "Consider: ECG, glucose, pertussis, RSV, urinalysis"
  - "Home monitoring NOT routinely recommended"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Low-risk BRUE: May discharge after 1-4 hour observation"
  - "Higher-risk BRUE: Admission for monitoring and evaluation"
  - "All: Close follow-up within 24-48 hours"
  - "CPR education for caregivers"
  - "Return precautions: Any repeat event"
  - "Subspecialty referral: Recurrent events, abnormal findings"

parent_styles: [terrified, CPR-seeking, reassurance-seeking]
