# Toddler's Fracture - Teaching Framework
topic: "Toddler's Fracture"
aliases: ["CAST fracture", "occult tibial fracture", "spiral tibial fracture"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [9, 48]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize clinical presentation in limping toddler"
  - "Know that X-ray may be normal initially"
  - "Understand appropriate imaging approach"
  - "Know when to treat empirically"
  - "Identify non-accidental trauma concerns"

common_mistakes:
  - "Dismissing when initial X-ray is negative"
  - "Missing in child who 'just stopped walking'"
  - "Not considering in appropriate age group"
  - "Excessive workup (MRI rarely needed)"
  - "Missing subtle X-ray findings"

red_flags:
  - "History inconsistent with injury"
  - "Non-ambulatory child with fracture"
  - "Multiple bruises or other injuries"
  - "Delay in seeking care"
  - "Bilateral injuries"
  - "Metaphyseal corner fractures (NAT)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Peak age: 9 months to 3 years"
  - "Classic: child suddenly won't walk or is limping"
  - "Minimal or no recalled trauma"
  - "Spiral or oblique fracture of distal tibial shaft"
  - "Initial X-ray negative in up to 40%"
  - "Periosteal reaction visible in 1-2 weeks"
  - "Point tenderness over distal tibia is key finding"
  - "Low threshold to treat empirically with splint if suspicious"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did limping start?"
  - "Any witnessed injury or fall?"
  - "Fever or illness?"
  - "Walking normally before this?"
  - "Any leg pain before?"
  - "Who was with the child when this started?"
  - "Developmental stage - cruising, walking, running?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Refusal to bear weight or limping"
  - "Point tenderness over distal tibia (key finding)"
  - "May have mild swelling"
  - "Hip, knee exam normal"
  - "No warmth or erythema (vs infection)"
  - "Neurovascular intact"
  - "Well-appearing (vs septic joint)"

treatment_principles:
  - "If X-ray positive: long leg cast or walking boot"
  - "If X-ray negative but clinically suspicious: treat empirically"
  - "Empiric treatment: posterior splint or walking boot"
  - "Pain control"
  - "Duration: 3-4 weeks immobilization"
  - "Repeat X-ray in 2 weeks may show healing/callus"
  - "Most heal uneventfully"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All uncomplicated cases"
  - "X-ray: AP and lateral tibia/fibula"
  - "If negative but suspicious: treat empirically, repeat films in 1-2 weeks"
  - "Orthopedic referral: Confirmation and casting"
  - "MRI: Rarely needed, consider if not improving"
  - "NAT evaluation: If mechanism doesn't fit or concerning features"
  - "Follow-up: 1-2 weeks for repeat X-ray if initial negative"

parent_styles: [worried-about-limping, NAT-defensive, looking-for-answers]
