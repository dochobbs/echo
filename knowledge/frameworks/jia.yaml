# Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis"
aliases: ["JIA", "juvenile arthritis", "JRA", "juvenile rheumatoid arthritis"]
category: msk
age_range_months: [12, 192]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know definition: Arthritis >6 weeks, onset <16 years, other causes excluded"
  - "Recognize different JIA subtypes"
  - "Understand uveitis screening is critical"
  - "Refer early to rheumatology"

common_mistakes:
  - "Waiting too long to refer (permanent joint damage can occur)"
  - "Missing uveitis screening (silent, can cause blindness)"
  - "Confusing 'growing pains' with arthritis"
  - "Checking RF/ANA first instead of referring"

red_flags:
  - "Systemic features (daily spiking fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly)"
  - "Uveitis symptoms (eye pain, redness, photophobia) - but often asymptomatic!"
  - "Rapidly progressive joint destruction"
  - "Features suggesting malignancy (night pain, weight loss, cytopenias)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Definition: Arthritis (swelling OR 2 of: limited ROM, pain, warmth) for >6 WEEKS in <16 year old"
  - "Morning stiffness, gelling phenomenon, better with activity - classic for inflammatory"
  - "ANA positive + oligoarticular = HIGHEST uveitis risk - ophthalmology every 3 months"
  - "Systemic JIA: Daily quotidian fever, salmon-pink rash - life-threatening complications"
  - "Refer to rheumatology - don't delay for labs"

key_history_questions:
  - "Which joints? How long have they been swollen?"
  - "Morning stiffness? How long? Better with activity?"
  - "Any fevers? Pattern of fever?"
  - "Any rash?"
  - "Any eye symptoms? Redness?"
  - "Family history of autoimmune diseases?"
  - "Weight loss, night sweats?"
  - "Recent infections?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Joint swelling - effusion, synovial thickening"
  - "Warmth (not typically red)"
  - "Limited range of motion, pain with motion"
  - "Leg length discrepancy (if chronic knee arthritis)"
  - "Count involved joints"
  - "Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly (systemic JIA)"
  - "Rash (salmon-pink, evanescent with fever in systemic)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Refer to pediatric rheumatology early"
  - "NSAIDs: First-line symptom control"
  - "DMARDs: Methotrexate for polyarticular"
  - "Biologics: TNF inhibitors, IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors for refractory"
  - "Intra-articular steroids for oligoarticular"
  - "Physical/occupational therapy"
  - "Ophthalmology screening: Critical to prevent blindness"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Rheumatology referral: All suspected JIA"
  - "Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP (to rule out other causes, not to diagnose JIA)"
  - "Ophthalmology: Slit-lamp exam for uveitis screening (frequency depends on subtype/ANA)"
  - "Urgent: Systemic symptoms, concern for MAS (macrophage activation syndrome)"
  - "Don't delay referral for extensive workup"
