# Impetigo & MRSA - Teaching Framework
topic: "Impetigo & Skin Infections"
aliases: ["impetigo", "MRSA", "skin abscess", "staph infection"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic impetigo presentation"
  - "Know when I&D alone is sufficient"
  - "Understand MRSA decolonization strategies"
  - "Avoid unnecessary systemic antibiotics"

common_mistakes:
  - "Prescribing oral antibiotics for small abscess (I&D is primary treatment)"
  - "Not draining fluctuant abscess"
  - "Using beta-lactams for suspected MRSA"
  - "Missing bullous impetigo"

red_flags:
  - "Cellulitis >2cm surrounding abscess"
  - "Systemic symptoms (fever, toxic appearance)"
  - "Rapidly spreading infection"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Honey crust = Classic non-bullous impetigo - treat with topical Mupirocin"
  - "Abscess: If fluctuant, I&D is PRIMARY treatment - antibiotics often unnecessary"
  - "Add oral antibiotics only if: cellulitis >2cm, systemic signs, or I&D not possible"
  - "Recurrent MRSA: Dilute bleach baths for decolonization"

key_history_questions:
  - "How long has the lesion been present?"
  - "Any trauma or bug bite preceding?"
  - "Previous skin infections? Recurrent?"
  - "Anyone else in household with similar?"
  - "Sports participation (wrestling, football)?"
  - "Any fever?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Lesion characteristics (crusted, bullous, fluctuant)"
  - "Size and location"
  - "Surrounding cellulitis"
  - "Regional lymphadenopathy"
  - "Temperature"
  - "Fluctuance assessment"

treatment_principles:
  - "Impetigo: Topical mupirocin if localized"
  - "Abscess: I&D primary treatment"
  - "Oral antibiotics: TMP-SMX or Clindamycin for MRSA coverage"
  - "Decolonization: Bleach baths, mupirocin to nares"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Localized infection, successful I&D"
  - "Admit: Extensive cellulitis, systemic toxicity, immunocompromised"
  - "Follow-up: 48-72 hours to assess response"

parent_styles: [worried-about-MRSA, wants-antibiotics, frustrated-with-recurrence]
