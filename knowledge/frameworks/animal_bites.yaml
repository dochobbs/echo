# Animal Bites - Teaching Framework
topic: "Animal Bites"
aliases: ["dog bite", "cat bite", "animal bite", "human bite"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know which bites require antibiotics"
  - "Understand rabies post-exposure prophylaxis indications"
  - "Recognize when to suture vs leave open"
  - "Assess tetanus status"

common_mistakes:
  - "Suturing all bites (high-risk wounds should be left open)"
  - "Not giving prophylactic antibiotics for high-risk bites"
  - "Missing cat bites as higher risk than dog bites"
  - "Not assessing rabies risk"

red_flags:
  - "Signs of infection (spreading cellulitis, purulent drainage)"
  - "Deep puncture wounds, especially from cats"
  - "Wounds near joints, tendons, bones"
  - "Bites to hands, face, genitals"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"
  - "Wild animal or unprovoked attack (rabies risk)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Cat bites: HIGHER infection risk than dogs (deep puncture) - always give prophylactic antibiotics"
  - "Dog bites: Crush injuries, lower infection rate than cats"
  - "Human bites: Treat like cat bites - high infection risk, include anaerobic coverage"
  - "Augmentin (amox-clav): First-line prophylaxis for most bites - covers Pasteurella, Capnocytophaga, anaerobes"
  - "Rabies PEP: Bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes - contact public health for guidance"

key_history_questions:
  - "What animal? Wild or domestic? Known or stray?"
  - "Provoked or unprovoked attack?"
  - "When did bite occur?"
  - "Where on body?"
  - "Any treatment so far?"
  - "Animal's vaccination status (if known)?"
  - "Child's immunization status (tetanus)?"
  - "Any immunocompromising conditions?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Wound assessment: Puncture vs laceration vs crush"
  - "Depth and tissue involvement"
  - "Signs of infection (erythema, warmth, drainage, lymphangitis)"
  - "Neurovascular status distal to injury"
  - "Joint involvement (test ROM, check for penetration)"
  - "Document wound size, location precisely"

treatment_principles:
  - "Irrigation: Copious with saline or water - most important treatment"
  - "Debridement: Remove devitalized tissue"
  - "Suturing: Primary closure for face; leave open for hands, punctures, >24h old"
  - "Prophylactic antibiotics: Amox-clav x 3-5 days for cat bites, hand bites, deep punctures, immunocompromised"
  - "Tetanus: Update if needed"
  - "Rabies PEP: Contact public health - indicated for bats, wild carnivores, stray/unknown animals"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Home: Most bites with wound care and antibiotics as indicated"
  - "ED: Deep wounds, joint/tendon/bone involvement, requiring sedation for repair"
  - "Admit: Established infection requiring IV antibiotics, hand infections"
  - "Report: Dog bites to animal control (local requirements vary)"
  - "Follow-up: 24-48 hours for wound check, especially high-risk wounds"
