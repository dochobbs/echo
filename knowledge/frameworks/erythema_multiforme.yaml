# Erythema Multiforme - Teaching Framework
topic: "Erythema Multiforme"
aliases: ["EM", "target lesions", "EM minor", "EM major"]
category: dermatology
age_range_months: [24, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic target lesions"
  - "Distinguish from urticaria and SJS/TEN"
  - "Identify common triggers"
  - "Know EM minor vs EM major"
  - "Understand self-limited nature"

common_mistakes:
  - "Confusing with Stevens-Johnson syndrome"
  - "Missing HSV as trigger"
  - "Over-treating with systemic steroids"
  - "Not evaluating for drug cause"
  - "Confusing targetoid urticaria with EM"

red_flags:
  - "Extensive mucosal involvement (SJS concern)"
  - "Skin sloughing or positive Nikolsky sign (TEN)"
  - "Fever with toxic appearance"
  - "Respiratory or GI mucosal involvement"
  - "Widespread atypical targets (SJS)"
  - "> 10% BSA detachment (TEN)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic target: 3 zones - central dusky, pale ring, erythematous border"
  - "Fixed lesions (don't migrate like urticaria)"
  - "Acral distribution: palms, soles, dorsal hands"
  - "HSV is #1 trigger (can cause recurrent EM)"
  - "Drug-induced: usually 1-3 weeks after starting"
  - "EM minor: skin only, no or minimal oral lesions"
  - "EM major: oral +/- genital mucosal involvement"
  - "EM is distinct from SJS/TEN (different pathophysiology)"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did rash start?"
  - "Recent herpes cold sore or genital herpes?"
  - "Recent infection?"
  - "Any new medications in past 1-4 weeks?"
  - "Previous similar episodes?"
  - "Mouth sores or genital lesions?"
  - "Fever or feeling sick?"
  - "Any skin peeling or blistering?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Target lesions (pathognomonic)"
  - "Distribution: palms, soles, extensor surfaces"
  - "Oral mucosal lesions (EM major)"
  - "Nikolsky sign negative (if positive = SJS/TEN)"
  - "No bullae or skin sloughing"
  - "Genital mucosa exam if symptoms"
  - "Assess BSA involvement"

treatment_principles:
  - "Self-limited: resolves in 1-4 weeks"
  - "Supportive care: antihistamines for itch, analgesia"
  - "Oral mucosal involvement: topical analgesics, magic mouthwash"
  - "Systemic steroids: controversial, not routinely recommended"
  - "Identify and treat trigger (HSV: consider suppressive antivirals)"
  - "Discontinue causative drug if identified"
  - "Recurrent EM: consider HSV suppression (acyclovir/valacyclovir)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: EM minor and most EM major"
  - "Admission: Extensive mucosal involvement, dehydration, diagnostic uncertainty"
  - "Dermatology referral: Recurrent episodes, diagnostic uncertainty"
  - "Return: Worsening rash, skin blistering/peeling, difficulty eating/drinking"
  - "HSV suppression: Consider if recurrent EM (valacyclovir prophylaxis)"
