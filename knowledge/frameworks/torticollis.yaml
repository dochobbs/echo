# Torticollis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Torticollis"
aliases: ["wry neck", "congenital muscular torticollis", "CMT"]
category: musculoskeletal
age_range_months: [0, 24]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize congenital muscular torticollis"
  - "Distinguish from acquired torticollis"
  - "Know when imaging or urgent evaluation needed"
  - "Understand physical therapy as primary treatment"
  - "Recognize red flags for serious causes"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing posterior fossa tumor presenting as torticollis"
  - "Not screening for developmental dysplasia of hip"
  - "Delaying physical therapy referral"
  - "Missing Sandifer syndrome (GERD-related)"
  - "Not reassessing if not improving with therapy"

red_flags:
  - "Acquired torticollis in older child (> 4 months without history)"
  - "Neurologic symptoms (headache, vomiting, ataxia)"
  - "Pain out of proportion"
  - "No improvement with stretching"
  - "Acute onset after trauma"
  - "Associated with fever (Grisel syndrome)"
  - "Visual disturbances"

clinical_pearls:
  - "CMT: head tilted to one side, chin rotated to opposite side"
  - "SCM muscle tightness/mass (pseudotumor of infancy)"
  - "Associated with DDH in 2-29% - screen hips"
  - "Plagiocephaly (flat head) from preferred position"
  - "PT is first-line: stretching, positioning, tummy time"
  - "90% resolve with PT by age 1"
  - "Acquired torticollis in older child - think posterior fossa tumor"
  - "Sandifer: torticollis with GERD symptoms, episodic"

key_history_questions:
  - "When first noticed?"
  - "Congenital or acquired?"
  - "Birth history (breech, difficult delivery)?"
  - "Getting better or worse?"
  - "Any trauma?"
  - "Pain?"
  - "Neurologic symptoms: headache, vomiting, vision changes?"
  - "GERD symptoms?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Direction of head tilt and chin rotation"
  - "SCM muscle tightness or mass"
  - "Active and passive range of motion"
  - "Plagiocephaly assessment"
  - "Hip exam (Ortolani, Barlow)"
  - "Neurologic exam"
  - "Eye movements (cranial nerve palsies)"

treatment_principles:
  - "CMT: early referral to physical therapy"
  - "Home stretching program"
  - "Positioning and tummy time"
  - "Helmet therapy if significant plagiocephaly"
  - "Botox or surgery for refractory cases"
  - "Treat underlying cause in acquired cases"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient PT referral: CMT identified early, no red flags"
  - "Hip ultrasound: If < 6 months with torticollis (DDH screening)"
  - "Imaging (MRI spine/brain): Acquired, not improving, neurologic signs"
  - "Urgent evaluation: Acute onset, trauma, fever, neurologic symptoms"
  - "Orthopedics/neurosurgery: C-spine abnormality, refractory CMT"
