# Tinea Capitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Tinea Capitis"
aliases: ["scalp ringworm", "ringworm of the scalp"]
category: dermatology
age_range_months: [24, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize varied presentations"
  - "Know that oral treatment is required (topical inadequate)"
  - "Understand importance of adjunctive antifungal shampoo"
  - "Identify kerion as inflammatory variant"
  - "Counsel on transmission prevention"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating with topical antifungals alone (doesn't penetrate hair follicle)"
  - "Mistaking kerion for bacterial abscess and incising"
  - "Missing seborrheic dermatitis or alopecia areata"
  - "Not treating for adequate duration"
  - "Not checking contacts"

red_flags:
  - "Kerion (boggy, painful, purulent mass) - NOT an abscess"
  - "Permanent scarring alopecia"
  - "Cervical lymphadenopathy (common with kerion)"
  - "Secondary bacterial infection"
  - "Id reaction (widespread dermatitis)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Scaly patches with hair loss and broken hairs ('black dot')"
  - "Most common cause in US: Trichophyton tonsurans"
  - "Kerion: inflammatory boggy mass, often misdiagnosed as abscess"
  - "Do NOT incise kerion - treat with oral antifungal + steroids"
  - "Oral griseofulvin is first-line: 6-8 weeks (sometimes longer)"
  - "Terbinafine: 2-4 weeks, increasing use"
  - "Antifungal shampoo (selenium sulfide, ketoconazole) reduces transmission"
  - "Can return to school after starting treatment"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did you first notice hair loss or scaling?"
  - "Is it itchy?"
  - "Any other family members or contacts with similar symptoms?"
  - "Any pets (cats, dogs) with skin problems?"
  - "Previous treatments tried?"
  - "Any drainage or pain?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Scaly patches on scalp"
  - "Broken hairs, black dots at follicles"
  - "Patchy alopecia"
  - "Kerion: boggy, tender mass with pustules"
  - "Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy"
  - "Wood's lamp: usually negative (T. tonsurans doesn't fluoresce)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Oral antifungal REQUIRED (topical doesn't penetrate)"
  - "First-line: griseofulvin microsize 20-25 mg/kg/day x 6-8 weeks"
  - "Alternative: terbinafine (weight-based dosing) x 2-4 weeks"
  - "Take with fatty food to improve absorption (griseofulvin)"
  - "Adjunctive: antifungal shampoo 2-3x/week"
  - "Kerion: oral antifungal + short course oral steroids"
  - "Treat until clinical AND microscopic cure"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Confirm diagnosis: KOH prep or fungal culture if uncertain"
  - "School: Can attend with treatment + adjunctive shampoo"
  - "Household contacts: Examine, treat if affected, use antifungal shampoo"
  - "Follow-up: 4-6 weeks to assess response, may need extended treatment"
  - "Dermatology referral: Treatment failure, uncertain diagnosis"
