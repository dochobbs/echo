# Acute Gastroenteritis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Acute Gastroenteritis"
aliases: ["stomach flu", "viral gastroenteritis", "acute diarrhea"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Use oral rehydration as first-line for mild-moderate dehydration"
  - "Know appropriate use of ondansetron"
  - "Avoid unnecessary dietary restrictions"
  - "Recognize dehydration requiring IV fluids"

common_mistakes:
  - "Jumping to IV fluids for mild-moderate dehydration"
  - "Repeat ondansetron dosing (QT risk, masks pathology)"
  - "Recommending BRAT diet (outdated)"
  - "Prescribing antibiotics for viral gastroenteritis"

red_flags:
  - "Severe dehydration"
  - "Bilious vomiting"
  - "Bloody diarrhea with high fever"
  - "Altered mental status"
  - "Abdominal distension/rigidity"

clinical_pearls:
  - "ORT (oral rehydration) is as safe and effective as IV for mild-moderate dehydration"
  - "Ondansetron: Single dose can facilitate ORT success - avoid repeat dosing"
  - "NO BRAT diet - resume normal diet ASAP to shorten illness"
  - "Most cases viral - antibiotics not indicated"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of vomiting and diarrhea?"
  - "Frequency of episodes?"
  - "Blood in stool?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Wet diapers in last 8-12 hours?"
  - "Able to keep fluids down?"
  - "Sick contacts? Daycare? Recent travel?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Dehydration assessment (mucous membranes, tears, skin turgor)"
  - "Capillary refill"
  - "Heart rate"
  - "Fontanelle in infants"
  - "Mental status"
  - "Abdominal exam"

treatment_principles:
  - "ORT first-line: Small frequent sips"
  - "Ondansetron single dose to facilitate ORT"
  - "IV fluids only for severe dehydration or ORT failure"
  - "Resume normal diet once tolerating fluids"
  - "Probiotics may reduce duration slightly"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Mild-moderate dehydration, tolerating ORT"
  - "ED observation: ORT trial, IV fluids if needed"
  - "Admit: Severe dehydration, unable to rehydrate, very young infant"

parent_styles: [worried-about-dehydration, wants-IV, experienced]
