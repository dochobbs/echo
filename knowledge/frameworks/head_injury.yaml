# Head Injury and Concussion - Teaching Framework
topic: "Head Injury and Concussion"
aliases: ["head injury", "concussion", "TBI", "traumatic brain injury", "head trauma"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Apply PECARN rules to avoid unnecessary CT"
  - "Recognize signs of increased ICP"
  - "Counsel on concussion management and return to activity"
  - "Know red flags for NAT (non-accidental trauma)"

common_mistakes:
  - "CT for every head bump"
  - "Returning to contact sports before symptom resolution"
  - "Missing NAT in infant with unexplained head injury"
  - "Not educating on post-concussive symptoms"

red_flags:
  - "GCS <15"
  - "Signs of skull fracture (palpable, Battle's sign, raccoon eyes)"
  - "Altered mental status"
  - "Severe headache, vomiting"
  - "Mechanism inconsistent with developmental stage (NAT)"
  - "Focal neurologic deficit"

clinical_pearls:
  - "PECARN rules: Validated to identify very low risk - can avoid CT"
  - "Under 2: Altered mental status, scalp hematoma (non-frontal), severe mechanism, LOC >5sec, palpable skull fracture, acting abnormal per parent"
  - "Over 2: Altered mental status, signs of basilar fracture, severe mechanism, LOC, vomiting, severe headache"
  - "Concussion: Return to learn BEFORE return to play"
  - "NAT: Any significant head injury in non-mobile infant is concerning"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism of injury? Witnessed?"
  - "Loss of consciousness? How long?"
  - "Vomiting? How many times?"
  - "Headache severity?"
  - "Behavior changes? Acting normally?"
  - "Seizure?"
  - "Developmental stage - is this plausible mechanism?"
  - "Previous concussions?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "GCS score (and Pediatric GCS for young children)"
  - "Scalp inspection - hematoma location and size"
  - "Skull palpation - step-off, crepitus"
  - "Signs of basilar fracture (hemotympanum, Battle's, raccoon eyes)"
  - "Neurologic exam - pupils, motor, reflexes"
  - "Fontanelle if open (bulging = ICP)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Apply PECARN - observe vs CT based on risk stratification"
  - "Low risk: 4-6 hours observation, discharge with precautions"
  - "Concussion: Cognitive and physical rest initially"
  - "Return to activity: Stepwise protocol after 24-48h asymptomatic"
  - "Return to LEARN before return to PLAY"
  - "No same-day return to contact sports after concussion"

disposition_guidance:
  - "ED: Moderate-high risk per PECARN, any concerning features"
  - "CT: Based on PECARN criteria"
  - "Admit: Abnormal CT, persistent altered mental status"
  - "Low risk: Home with strict return precautions"
  - "Follow-up: In 1-2 weeks for concussion, sooner if symptoms worsen"
