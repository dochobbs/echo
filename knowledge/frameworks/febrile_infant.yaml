# Febrile Infant (8-60 Days) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Febrile Infant"
aliases: ["fever in young infant", "neonatal fever", "infant fever workup"]
category: newborn
age_range_months: [0, 2]

teaching_goals:
  - "Apply age-stratified approach: 8-21 days vs 22-60 days"
  - "Use inflammatory markers (Procalcitonin, ANC, CRP) to stratify risk"
  - "Know when HSV testing is mandatory"
  - "Understand urinalysis as most sensitive screen"
  - "Recognize which infants require admission vs can be observed"

common_mistakes:
  - "Sending home ANY infant 8-21 days old with fever (all need admission)"
  - "Forgetting to consider HSV in infants <21 days"
  - "Using bag urine specimen (catheter or suprapubic required)"
  - "Over-relying on 'well-appearing' in very young infants"
  - "Forgetting to ask about maternal history (GBS, HSV, ROM)"

red_flags:
  - "Age 8-21 days (automatic high risk)"
  - "Ill-appearing or inconsolable"
  - "Vesicular rash (HSV)"
  - "Seizure activity"
  - "Bulging fontanelle"
  - "Maternal HSV history"
  - "Prematurity <37 weeks"

clinical_pearls:
  - "8-21 Days = Automatic Admission + Full sepsis workup + IV antibiotics"
  - "22-60 Days = Use inflammatory markers to stratify risk"
  - "HSV: Test in any infant <21 days or with seizures/vesicles/maternal history"
  - "Urinalysis is the most sensitive screen - negative UA rules out most bacterial infections"
  - "Procalcitonin <0.5 ng/mL has high negative predictive value"

key_history_questions:
  - "Exact age in days?"
  - "Fever duration and maximum temperature?"
  - "Feeding - how much, how often?"
  - "Maternal history - GBS status, HSV, ROM duration, chorioamnionitis?"
  - "Birth history - premature? NICU stay?"
  - "Sick contacts?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "General appearance (well vs ill)"
  - "Fontanelle (soft/flat vs bulging)"
  - "Skin (vesicles, rashes, mottling)"
  - "Capillary refill"
  - "Consolability"

treatment_principles:
  - "8-21 days: Ampicillin + Cefotaxime (or Gentamicin) IV"
  - "Consider Acyclovir if HSV risk factors"
  - "22-60 days low-risk: May observe at home with guaranteed 24h follow-up"
  - "Obtain Blood/Urine culture before antibiotics"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit ALL infants 8-21 days with fever"
  - "22-60 days: Low-risk may observe outpatient with reliable follow-up"
  - "Low-risk criteria: Well-appearing, negative UA, normal inflammatory markers"

age_specific_considerations:
  early_neonate:
    age_days: [8, 21]
    notes: "Full sepsis workup + Admission + IV antibiotics for ALL"
  older_infant:
    age_days: [22, 60]
    notes: "Risk stratify with inflammatory markers"

parent_styles: [terrified, experienced, hesitant-about-workup]
