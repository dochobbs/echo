# Subconjunctival Hemorrhage - Teaching Framework
topic: "Subconjunctival Hemorrhage"
aliases: ["SCH", "red eye", "eye bleed", "bloody eye"]
category: ophthalmology
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize benign nature of isolated SCH"
  - "Distinguish from more serious eye injuries"
  - "Know when workup is indicated"
  - "Identify associated causes"
  - "Counsel on natural resolution"

common_mistakes:
  - "Extensive workup for simple SCH"
  - "Missing associated globe injury"
  - "Not asking about bleeding history with recurrent SCH"
  - "Prescribing unnecessary eye drops"
  - "Missing Valsalva triggers"

red_flags:
  - "Associated eye pain or vision change"
  - "Hyphema (blood in anterior chamber)"
  - "Pupil abnormality"
  - "Globe rupture (mechanism, irregular pupil)"
  - "Recurrent without clear cause"
  - "Bleeding elsewhere (bruising, epistaxis)"
  - "Significant trauma"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Bright red, flat, well-demarcated blood under conjunctiva"
  - "Looks dramatic but is benign"
  - "Vision and pupil are normal"
  - "Causes: coughing, sneezing, Valsalva, minor trauma, spontaneous"
  - "In newborns: birth trauma - resolves spontaneously"
  - "Resolves in 1-2 weeks, may spread before clearing"
  - "No treatment needed"
  - "Color change: red -> purple -> yellow (like bruise)"

key_history_questions:
  - "Any trauma?"
  - "Coughing, sneezing, vomiting, straining?"
  - "Any pain?"
  - "Vision changes?"
  - "History of easy bruising or bleeding?"
  - "Blood thinners (in adolescents/household)?"
  - "Previous similar episodes?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Bright red blood under clear conjunctiva"
  - "Flat (not raised)"
  - "Does NOT involve cornea"
  - "Visual acuity normal"
  - "Pupil normal in shape and reactivity"
  - "No pain with eye movement"
  - "Anterior chamber clear (no hyphema)"

treatment_principles:
  - "No treatment necessary"
  - "Reassurance - looks worse than it is"
  - "Resolves spontaneously in 1-2 weeks"
  - "Artificial tears for comfort if mild irritation"
  - "Cool compresses optional"
  - "May use sunglasses if self-conscious"
  - "If on blood thinners: no need to stop"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All simple SCH"
  - "Ophthalmology: Vision change, pain, hyphema, globe injury concern"
  - "Hematology workup: Recurrent SCH, other bleeding, family history"
  - "Return: Vision changes, increasing pain, not resolving in 2-3 weeks"
  - "Counsel: Will likely spread and change colors before resolving"

parent_styles: [alarmed-by-appearance, worried-about-eye-damage, reassured-easily]
