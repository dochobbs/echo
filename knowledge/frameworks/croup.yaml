# Croup (Laryngotracheitis) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Croup"
aliases: ["laryngotracheitis", "viral croup", "barky cough"]
category: respiratory
age_range_months: [6, 72]

teaching_goals:
  - "Diagnose croup clinically without imaging"
  - "Use Westley score to assess severity"
  - "Know dexamethasone is indicated for ALL severities"
  - "Understand racemic epinephrine observation requirements"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not giving steroids for mild croup"
  - "Ordering neck X-ray routinely (steeple sign not needed)"
  - "Sending home immediately after racemic epinephrine"
  - "Missing severe croup requiring hospitalization"

red_flags:
  - "Stridor at rest"
  - "Severe retractions"
  - "Cyanosis or altered mental status"
  - "Drooling or toxic appearance (consider epiglottitis)"
  - "No response to steroids/epinephrine"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (single dose) indicated for ALL severity levels"
  - "Steroids reduce return visits and severity"
  - "Westley Score: Stridor at rest + Retractions = Severe"
  - "Racemic epinephrine: Observe 2-4 hours for 'rebound' effect"
  - "Barky 'seal-like' cough is pathognomonic"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of symptoms?"
  - "Barky cough present?"
  - "Stridor - at rest or only when crying?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "URI symptoms preceding?"
  - "Previous croup episodes?"
  - "Able to drink fluids?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Barky cough (listen for it)"
  - "Stridor (inspiratory vs biphasic)"
  - "Work of breathing (retractions)"
  - "Air entry"
  - "Mental status"
  - "Oxygen saturation"
  - "Drooling (suggests epiglottitis)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IM - single dose for all"
  - "Racemic epinephrine for moderate-severe"
  - "Observe 2-4 hours after racemic epinephrine"
  - "Supportive care: Humidified air, comfort measures"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Discharge: Mild croup after steroids, no stridor at rest"
  - "Observe: After racemic epinephrine (2-4 hours)"
  - "Admit: Persistent stridor at rest, multiple epinephrine doses, hypoxia"

seasonality:
  peak_months: [10, 11, 12, 1, 2]
  pattern: "Fall/Winter predominance"

parent_styles: [scared-by-stridor, experienced-with-croup, wants-antibiotics]
