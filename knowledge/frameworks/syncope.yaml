# Syncope - Teaching Framework
topic: "Syncope"
aliases: ["fainting", "passing out", "vasovagal syncope"]
category: cardiovascular
age_range_months: [60, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish benign from dangerous causes of syncope"
  - "Recognize red flags for cardiac syncope"
  - "Know when ECG and further workup is needed"
  - "Understand vasovagal mechanism and triggers"
  - "Counsel on prevention strategies"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing cardiac syncope red flags"
  - "Not obtaining ECG in all cases"
  - "Confusing syncope with seizure"
  - "Over-testing low-risk vasovagal syncope"
  - "Not asking about exertional symptoms"
  - "Missing family history of sudden death"

red_flags:
  - "Syncope during exercise (not after)"
  - "Syncope while supine or swimming"
  - "Associated chest pain or palpitations"
  - "Family history of sudden cardiac death < 50 years"
  - "Family history of cardiomyopathy, Long QT, Brugada"
  - "Abnormal cardiac exam"
  - "No prodrome (abrupt loss of consciousness)"
  - "Recurrent episodes"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Vasovagal: prodrome (lightheaded, warm, nausea), trigger, quick recovery"
  - "Cardiac: sudden onset, during exertion, no prodrome, chest pain"
  - "Convulsive movements can occur with syncope - doesn't mean seizure"
  - "ECG should be done on ALL patients with syncope"
  - "Long QT interval > 470ms in males, > 480ms in females is concerning"
  - "Most pediatric syncope is vasovagal and benign"
  - "Dehydration and prolonged standing are common triggers"

key_history_questions:
  - "What were they doing when it happened?"
  - "Any warning signs before (prodrome)?"
  - "Position at time of event?"
  - "How long were they unconscious?"
  - "Any witnessed movements, incontinence, tongue biting?"
  - "Recovery time and post-event confusion?"
  - "Recent illness, hydration status, sleep?"
  - "Family history of sudden death, fainting, heart conditions?"
  - "Previous episodes?"
  - "Drug or medication use?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Cardiac auscultation (murmur, irregular rhythm)"
  - "Blood pressure (orthostatic measurements)"
  - "Heart rate"
  - "Neurologic exam"
  - "Stigmata of genetic syndromes (Marfan features)"

treatment_principles:
  - "ECG for all patients"
  - "Vasovagal: increase salt and fluid intake"
  - "Counter-pressure maneuvers (leg crossing, hand grip)"
  - "Avoid triggers (prolonged standing, dehydration, heat)"
  - "Recognize prodrome and assume safe position"
  - "No driving restrictions for vasovagal (when applicable)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Classic vasovagal with normal ECG and exam"
  - "Cardiology referral: Any red flags, abnormal ECG, exertional syncope"
  - "Emergency: Syncope with chest pain, arrhythmia, or abnormal vitals"
  - "Neurology: Features suggesting seizure (prolonged confusion, postictal)"
