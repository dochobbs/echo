# Infantile Hemangiomas - Teaching Framework
topic: "Infantile Hemangiomas"
aliases: ["hemangioma", "strawberry hemangioma", "vascular birthmark"]
category: derm
age_range_months: [0, 24]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know the natural history (proliferate then involute)"
  - "Recognize high-risk locations requiring treatment"
  - "Understand propranolol is first-line for concerning hemangiomas"
  - "Identify PHACE and LUMBAR syndromes"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating all hemangiomas (most involute spontaneously)"
  - "Waiting too long for high-risk locations (periocular, airway)"
  - "Not referring periocular hemangiomas urgently (amblyopia risk)"
  - "Missing segmental hemangiomas that may have associated anomalies"

red_flags:
  - "Periocular: Risk of amblyopia - urgent treatment"
  - "Airway (beard distribution): Monitor for stridor"
  - "Large facial/segmental: Evaluate for PHACE syndrome"
  - "Lumbosacral midline: Evaluate for spinal dysraphism"
  - "Ulceration: Pain, infection, scarring risk"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Natural history: Appear first weeks of life, proliferate until 9-12 months, then INVOLUTE over years"
  - "Most resolve by age 4 with minimal residua - observation is often appropriate"
  - "Propranolol: First-line for concerning hemangiomas - start 1-2 mg/kg/day"
  - "PHACE: Posterior fossa, Hemangioma, Arterial, Cardiac, Eye anomalies"
  - "5+ hemangiomas: Screen for hepatic hemangiomas (abdominal ultrasound)"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did it appear? Has it grown?"
  - "Any color changes or ulceration?"
  - "Location - near eye, nose, lip, airway?"
  - "Any feeding difficulties or stridor?"
  - "Family history of vascular anomalies?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Bright red, raised, well-demarcated (superficial)"
  - "Bluish hue if deep component"
  - "Location and size documentation"
  - "Segmental vs focal distribution"
  - "Signs of ulceration"
  - "Count total number of hemangiomas"

treatment_principles:
  - "Most: Observation and reassurance"
  - "High-risk (periocular, airway, disfiguring): Oral propranolol"
  - "Propranolol: 1-3 mg/kg/day divided BID-TID, monitor HR and glucose"
  - "Ulcerated: Wound care, may need propranolol"
  - "Timolol: Topical option for small, superficial lesions"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "Urgent dermatology/ophthalmology: Periocular hemangioma"
  - "Subspecialty evaluation: Large facial, segmental, or multiple"
  - "MRI: Segmental lumbosacral (spinal dysraphism screen)"
  - "Echo: Large segmental facial (PHACE)"
