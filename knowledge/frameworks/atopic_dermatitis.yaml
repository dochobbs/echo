# Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Atopic Dermatitis"
aliases: ["eczema", "atopic eczema"]
category: derm
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Master soak and seal technique"
  - "Address steroid phobia"
  - "Understand food rarely causes eczema"
  - "Know when to escalate therapy"

common_mistakes:
  - "Under-treating due to steroid phobia"
  - "Using creams instead of ointments"
  - "Elimination diets without proven food allergy"
  - "Not addressing skin barrier (moisturizers)"

red_flags:
  - "Eczema herpeticum (HSV superinfection)"
  - "Severe, widespread disease"
  - "Failure to respond to appropriate treatment"
  - "Associated with failure to thrive"

clinical_pearls:
  - "SOAK AND SEAL: Bathe → Pat dry → Apply meds/moisturizer while DAMP"
  - "Ointments > Creams (better hydration, fewer additives)"
  - "Topical steroids are SAFE - under-treatment is the bigger risk"
  - "Food allergy rarely CAUSES eczema - avoid elimination diets without proof"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did it start? Where?"
  - "What makes it better or worse?"
  - "Current skin care routine?"
  - "What treatments have been tried?"
  - "Family history of eczema, asthma, allergies?"
  - "Any suspected food triggers?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Distribution (flexural in older children, face/extensors in infants)"
  - "Xerosis (dry skin)"
  - "Lichenification (chronic changes)"
  - "Signs of infection (crusting, pustules)"
  - "Severity assessment"

treatment_principles:
  - "Moisturizers: Thick ointments, apply immediately after bathing"
  - "Topical steroids: Match potency to severity and location"
  - "Flare: Increase steroid potency temporarily"
  - "Maintenance: Low-potency steroid or calcineurin inhibitor for chronic areas"
  - "Bleach baths: For recurrent infections"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "Dermatology referral: Severe, refractory, needing systemic therapy"
  - "Urgent: Eczema herpeticum, severe bacterial superinfection"
