# Dental Trauma - Teaching Framework
topic: "Dental Trauma"
aliases: ["tooth injury", "avulsed tooth", "knocked out tooth", "chipped tooth"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know management of avulsed permanent tooth (emergency)"
  - "Distinguish primary from permanent tooth management"
  - "Recognize different injury types"
  - "Know when dental referral is urgent"
  - "Provide appropriate first aid guidance"

common_mistakes:
  - "Reimplanting primary teeth (don't do this)"
  - "Letting avulsed permanent tooth dry out"
  - "Scrubbing the root of avulsed tooth"
  - "Delaying reimplantation of permanent tooth"
  - "Missing associated injuries (jaw fracture, head injury)"

red_flags:
  - "Avulsed permanent tooth (time-sensitive emergency)"
  - "Unable to close jaw (mandible fracture)"
  - "Multiple loose teeth (alveolar fracture)"
  - "Significant bleeding not controlled"
  - "Associated head injury"
  - "Aspiration risk (missing tooth)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "PRIMARY tooth avulsed: DO NOT reimplant (risk to permanent tooth bud)"
  - "PERMANENT tooth avulsed: reimplant ASAP, best outcomes < 30 min"
  - "Handle avulsed tooth by crown only (don't touch root)"
  - "Rinse gently with saline, don't scrub"
  - "Storage: tooth in milk, saline, or in patient's cheek"
  - "Splinting needed after reimplantation"
  - "Primary teeth: upper central incisors most common age 1-3"
  - "Permanent teeth: upper central incisors, boys > girls"

key_history_questions:
  - "What happened? When?"
  - "Primary or permanent tooth?"
  - "Where is the tooth now?"
  - "Any jaw pain or abnormal bite?"
  - "Able to fully open and close mouth?"
  - "Any head injury or loss of consciousness?"
  - "Tetanus status?"
  - "Any missing teeth unaccounted for (aspiration risk)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Identify injured tooth/teeth"
  - "Bleeding controlled?"
  - "Tooth mobility, displacement"
  - "Jaw alignment and mobility"
  - "Ability to occlude normally"
  - "Soft tissue injuries (lip, gingiva)"
  - "Signs of jaw fracture"
  - "Neurologic exam if head injury"

treatment_principles:
  - "AVULSED PERMANENT: reimplant immediately if possible"
  - "  Handle by crown, rinse briefly with saline"
  - "  Have patient bite on gauze to hold in place"
  - "  Urgent dental follow-up for splinting"
  - "AVULSED PRIMARY: do NOT reimplant"
  - "Luxation/intrusion: dental referral (urgent for permanent)"
  - "Fractures: dental referral, cover exposed dentin/pulp"
  - "Soft tissue: suture if needed, tetanus update"
  - "Pain control, soft diet"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Immediate dental/OMFS: Avulsed permanent tooth, alveolar fracture"
  - "Urgent dental (24-48h): Luxation, intrusion, crown fracture exposing pulp"
  - "Routine dental: Minor chip, primary tooth injuries"
  - "CXR/abd film: If tooth missing and not accounted for (aspiration)"
  - "Return: Increased pain, swelling, fever, color change in tooth"

parent_styles: [panicked, cosmetically-concerned, saving-the-tooth]
