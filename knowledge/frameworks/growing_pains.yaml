# Growing Pains - Teaching Framework
topic: "Growing Pains"
aliases: ["benign nocturnal limb pains", "recurrent limb pain of childhood"]
category: musculoskeletal
age_range_months: [36, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic pattern of growing pains"
  - "Distinguish from concerning causes of limb pain"
  - "Know when workup is indicated"
  - "Counsel on benign nature and management"
  - "Identify red flags suggesting other diagnoses"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering unnecessary imaging for classic presentation"
  - "Missing inflammatory or malignant causes"
  - "Attributing daytime or joint pain to growing pains"
  - "Not examining for joint swelling or limited ROM"
  - "Failing to provide reassurance"

red_flags:
  - "Daytime pain or limping"
  - "Joint swelling, warmth, or redness"
  - "Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue)"
  - "Pain that wakes from sleep and doesn't resolve with comfort"
  - "Unilateral bone pain"
  - "Morning stiffness > 15 minutes"
  - "Limited range of motion"
  - "Point tenderness over bone"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic: bilateral, lower extremity, muscle pain (not joints)"
  - "Occurs late day or awakens child at night"
  - "Relieved by massage, heat, or comfort measures"
  - "Completely normal exam the next morning"
  - "Peak ages: 3-5 and 8-12 years"
  - "Not actually related to growth - mechanism unknown"
  - "May be related to overuse or low pain threshold"
  - "Family history often positive"

key_history_questions:
  - "Location: muscles or joints?"
  - "Bilateral or unilateral?"
  - "Time of day pain occurs?"
  - "Does pain wake from sleep? Does it resolve?"
  - "Any limping?"
  - "Activity level - increased recently?"
  - "Systemic symptoms: fever, weight loss, fatigue?"
  - "Morning stiffness?"
  - "Family history of growing pains?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Normal examination required for diagnosis"
  - "No joint swelling, warmth, or redness"
  - "Full range of motion"
  - "Normal gait"
  - "No point tenderness over bones"
  - "Normal muscle strength"
  - "Normal growth parameters"

treatment_principles:
  - "Reassurance - benign and self-limited"
  - "Massage affected areas"
  - "Heating pad or warm bath before bed"
  - "Stretching exercises"
  - "NSAIDs or acetaminophen for severe episodes"
  - "Regular physical activity (not restriction)"
  - "Typically resolves by adolescence"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Classic presentation with normal exam"
  - "Labs if concerning: CBC, ESR, CRP"
  - "Imaging if: limp, unilateral, bone tenderness, abnormal exam"
  - "Rheumatology referral: Joint involvement, morning stiffness, systemic symptoms"
  - "Oncology workup: Night sweats, weight loss, bone pain, cytopenias"
  - "Follow-up: If symptoms worsen or new features develop"
