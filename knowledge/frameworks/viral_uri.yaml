# Viral URI / Common Cold - Teaching Framework
topic: "Viral Upper Respiratory Infection"
aliases: ["common cold", "viral URI", "rhinitis", "nasopharyngitis"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize viral URI as self-limited illness"
  - "Distinguish from bacterial complications"
  - "Avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescribing"
  - "Counsel on symptomatic management"
  - "Set appropriate expectations for duration"

common_mistakes:
  - "Prescribing antibiotics for viral illness"
  - "Using cough/cold medications in young children"
  - "Diagnosing sinusitis before 10 days of symptoms"
  - "Not setting expectations for symptom duration"
  - "Missing bacterial superinfection"

red_flags:
  - "Respiratory distress"
  - "High fever > 5 days"
  - "Worsening after initial improvement (double-sickening)"
  - "Severe unilateral facial pain"
  - "Toxic appearance"
  - "Symptoms > 10 days without improvement"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Average duration: 7-10 days, cough can persist 2-3 weeks"
  - "Children average 6-8 URIs per year"
  - "Nasal discharge color does NOT indicate bacterial infection"
  - "Peak symptoms days 2-3, gradual improvement thereafter"
  - "OTC cough/cold meds not recommended < 6 years (FDA)"
  - "Honey (> 1 year) may help nocturnal cough"
  - "Antibiotics provide no benefit and cause harm"

key_history_questions:
  - "How many days of symptoms?"
  - "Getting better, worse, or same?"
  - "Fever? How high and for how long?"
  - "Able to drink fluids?"
  - "Any breathing difficulty?"
  - "Previous URIs this season?"
  - "Sick contacts?"
  - "Any underlying conditions (asthma, immunodeficiency)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Nasal congestion and rhinorrhea"
  - "Pharyngeal erythema (without exudate)"
  - "Clear or colored nasal discharge"
  - "Mild conjunctival injection"
  - "Cervical lymphadenopathy"
  - "Clear lungs"
  - "No respiratory distress"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care only - no antibiotics"
  - "Saline nasal drops/spray"
  - "Humidifier"
  - "Adequate hydration"
  - "Acetaminophen/ibuprofen for fever/discomfort"
  - "Honey for cough (> 1 year old)"
  - "Avoid OTC cough/cold medications < 6 years"
  - "Nasal suctioning for infants"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All uncomplicated cases"
  - "Return if: Symptoms > 10 days, worsening after improvement, high fever > 5 days"
  - "Return if: Difficulty breathing, refusing fluids, ear pain"
  - "No school exclusion needed unless fever or unable to participate"
