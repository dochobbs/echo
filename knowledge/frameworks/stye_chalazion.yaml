# Stye and Chalazion - Teaching Framework
topic: "Hordeolum and Chalazion"
aliases: ["stye", "hordeolum", "chalazion", "eyelid bump"]
category: ophthalmology
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish hordeolum (stye) from chalazion"
  - "Differentiate internal from external hordeolum"
  - "Know conservative management as first-line"
  - "Recognize when referral is needed"
  - "Identify preseptal cellulitis complication"

common_mistakes:
  - "Prescribing oral antibiotics for simple stye"
  - "Recommending incision too early"
  - "Missing preseptal cellulitis"
  - "Not counseling on warm compress technique"
  - "Confusing with chalazion management"

red_flags:
  - "Fever with eyelid swelling"
  - "Proptosis or limited eye movement"
  - "Vision changes"
  - "Spreading erythema beyond eyelid"
  - "Multiple recurrent lesions (blepharitis)"
  - "Not improving after 1-2 weeks"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Hordeolum (stye): acute, painful, infected gland - S. aureus"
  - "External: eyelash follicle (gland of Zeis/Moll)"
  - "Internal: meibomian gland"
  - "Chalazion: chronic, painless, lipogranuloma - NOT infected"
  - "Warm compresses 4x daily for 10-15 minutes"
  - "Most resolve spontaneously in 1-2 weeks"
  - "Never squeeze or pop"

key_history_questions:
  - "How long has the bump been present?"
  - "Painful or painless?"
  - "Getting bigger or smaller?"
  - "Previous similar episodes?"
  - "Any vision changes?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Contact lens use?"
  - "Eyelid hygiene routine?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Location: lid margin (external) vs inner lid (internal)"
  - "Tender vs non-tender"
  - "Pointing/draining vs firm nodule"
  - "Eyelid erythema and edema"
  - "Conjunctival injection"
  - "Visual acuity"
  - "Extraocular movements"
  - "Signs of preseptal cellulitis"

treatment_principles:
  - "Warm compresses: 10-15 min, 4x daily"
  - "Gentle lid massage after compress"
  - "Lid hygiene with baby shampoo"
  - "Topical antibiotic ointment (erythromycin) - optional for hordeolum"
  - "No oral antibiotics unless cellulitis"
  - "Chalazion: may need steroid injection or I&D if persistent"
  - "Never incise acute hordeolum"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All simple cases"
  - "Ophthalmology referral: Chalazion > 6-8 weeks, recurrent, affecting vision"
  - "Urgent evaluation: Preseptal cellulitis signs"
  - "Return: Not improving in 1-2 weeks, spreading redness, fever"
  - "Recurrent: Evaluate for blepharitis, consider lid hygiene regimen"

parent_styles: [cosmetically-concerned, impatient-for-resolution, experienced]
