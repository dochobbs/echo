# Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction - Teaching Framework
topic: "Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction"
aliases: ["dacryostenosis", "blocked tear duct", "NLDO", "dacryocystitis"]
category: ophthalmology
age_range_months: [0, 12]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize congenital NLDO presentation"
  - "Distinguish from conjunctivitis"
  - "Know conservative management techniques"
  - "Identify when referral for probing is needed"
  - "Recognize dacryocystitis as complication"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating with antibiotics chronically"
  - "Diagnosing as recurrent conjunctivitis"
  - "Not teaching massage technique properly"
  - "Referring too early (most resolve by 12 months)"
  - "Missing acute dacryocystitis"

red_flags:
  - "Dacryocystitis (erythema and swelling over lacrimal sac)"
  - "Periorbital cellulitis"
  - "Fever with eye findings"
  - "Eye itself red and inflamed (may be true conjunctivitis)"
  - "Not resolving by 12 months"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Present in 6% of newborns"
  - "90%+ resolve spontaneously by age 12 months"
  - "Caused by membrane at distal nasolacrimal duct (valve of Hasner)"
  - "Tearing (epiphora) and crusting, especially in morning"
  - "Eye itself is NOT red (unlike conjunctivitis)"
  - "Crigler massage: press over lacrimal sac, stroke downward"
  - "Massage 2-3 times daily helps open duct"
  - "Probing if not resolved by 9-12 months"

key_history_questions:
  - "Since birth or new onset?"
  - "One eye or both?"
  - "Excessive tearing?"
  - "Crusting or discharge?"
  - "Eye redness?"
  - "Swelling between eye and nose?"
  - "Any fever?"
  - "Previous treatments?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Tearing (epiphora)"
  - "Mucopurulent discharge at medial canthus"
  - "No conjunctival injection (eye white is white)"
  - "Reflux of mucoid material with lacrimal sac pressure"
  - "Lacrimal sac area: any erythema or swelling?"
  - "Eyelid position and lashes normal"

treatment_principles:
  - "Conservative management first-line"
  - "Crigler massage: 10 strokes, 2-3 times daily"
  - "Clean discharge with warm water and cotton ball"
  - "Topical antibiotics only for mucopurulent discharge episodes"
  - "Antibiotics don't cure obstruction, just treat secondary infection"
  - "Dacryocystitis: oral antibiotics, possible admission"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All uncomplicated NLDO"
  - "Ophthalmology referral: Not resolved by 9-12 months for probing"
  - "Earlier referral: Recurrent dacryocystitis"
  - "Urgent referral: Acute dacryocystitis, periorbital cellulitis"
  - "Follow-up: Routine well visits, refer if not improving by 9-12 months"

parent_styles: [frustrated-by-persistence, antibiotic-seeking, reassurance-seeking]
