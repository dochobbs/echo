# Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip"
aliases: ["DDH", "hip dysplasia", "congenital hip dislocation"]
category: newborn
age_range_months: [0, 12]

teaching_goals:
  - "Identify DDH risk factors requiring screening"
  - "Know when ultrasound vs X-ray is indicated"
  - "Perform Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers correctly"
  - "Distinguish pathologic clunk from benign click"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not screening breech females with ultrasound at 6 weeks"
  - "Ordering X-ray before 4-6 months (femoral head not ossified)"
  - "Confusing benign hip clicks with pathologic clunks"
  - "Missing asymmetric skin folds as a screening sign"

red_flags:
  - "Positive Ortolani or Barlow maneuver"
  - "Asymmetric thigh or gluteal folds"
  - "Leg length discrepancy"
  - "Limited hip abduction"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Risk factors: Female, Breech (≥34 weeks), Family History"
  - "Breech females require ultrasound at 6 weeks even if exam is normal"
  - "Ultrasound for <4 months; X-ray (AP/Frog leg) for >4-6 months"
  - "Ortolani/Barlow feel like a CLUNK (dislocation/reduction); clicks are benign"

key_history_questions:
  - "Presentation at birth - breech or vertex?"
  - "Family history of hip dysplasia?"
  - "Sex of infant?"
  - "First-born child?"
  - "Oligohydramnios during pregnancy?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Ortolani maneuver (reducing a dislocated hip)"
  - "Barlow maneuver (dislocating an unstable hip)"
  - "Hip abduction symmetry"
  - "Leg length comparison (Galeazzi sign)"
  - "Thigh and gluteal fold symmetry"

treatment_principles:
  - "Pavlik harness for infants <6 months"
  - "Closed or open reduction for older infants"
  - "Early referral to pediatric orthopedics"
  - "Serial imaging to monitor treatment"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Risk factor screening with ultrasound at 6 weeks"
  - "Orthopedic referral: Positive exam findings or abnormal imaging"
  - "Urgent referral: Late presentation with fixed dislocation"

parent_styles: [anxious, curious, worried-about-treatment]
