# Food Allergy Prevention - Teaching Framework
topic: "Food Allergy Prevention"
aliases: ["peanut allergy prevention", "early allergen introduction"]
category: respiratory
age_range_months: [4, 12]

teaching_goals:
  - "Understand early introduction prevents allergies"
  - "Identify high-risk infants for early testing"
  - "Know testing limitations (high false positive)"
  - "Counsel appropriately on introduction"

common_mistakes:
  - "Delaying allergenic food introduction (increases risk)"
  - "Screening with IgE panels without reaction history (false positives)"
  - "Strict avoidance 'just in case'"
  - "Confusing intolerance with allergy"

red_flags:
  - "Severe eczema + egg allergy (highest risk for peanut)"
  - "Previous anaphylactic reaction"
  - "Multiple confirmed food allergies"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Early introduction (4-6 months) PREVENTS food allergies - do not delay"
  - "LEAP study: 80% reduction in peanut allergy with early introduction"
  - "High-risk (severe eczema): May need peanut IgE before introduction"
  - "Do NOT screen with IgE panels without history of reaction - high false positive"

key_history_questions:
  - "Any eczema? How severe?"
  - "Any known allergies?"
  - "Any previous reactions to foods?"
  - "Family history of food allergies?"
  - "Has the child started solids?"
  - "Which foods introduced so far?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Eczema presence and severity"
  - "Growth parameters"
  - "No active allergic symptoms"

treatment_principles:
  - "Introduce peanut, egg, dairy early (4-6 months)"
  - "High-risk (severe eczema): Consider peanut IgE testing first"
  - "Positive test alone is not diagnosis - need clinical correlation"
  - "Allergist referral for confirmed allergies or high-risk"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Counseling on early introduction"
  - "Allergist referral: Severe eczema, positive testing, confirmed reactions"
  - "No testing: In absence of reaction history"

parent_styles: [anxious-about-allergies, delayed-introduction, wants-testing]
