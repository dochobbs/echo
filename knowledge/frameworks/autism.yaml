topic: "Autism Spectrum Disorder"
aliases: ["autism", "ASD", "autism spectrum"]
category: behavioral
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize early signs (18-24 months)"
  - "Know screening tools (M-CHAT-R/F)"
  - "Understand early intervention is critical"
  - "Counsel families appropriately after diagnosis"

common_mistakes:
  - "Waiting to screen ('He'll grow out of it')"
  - "Confusing speech delay with autism"
  - "Not referring for early intervention immediately"
  - "Missing high-functioning/less obvious presentations"

red_flags:
  - "No babbling by 12 months"
  - "No gestures (pointing, waving) by 12 months"
  - "No single words by 16 months"
  - "No 2-word phrases by 24 months"
  - "ANY loss of language or social skills at any age"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Screen ALL children at 18 and 24 months (AAP recommendation)"
  - "M-CHAT-R/F: Free, validated screener for 16-30 months"
  - "Don't wait for formal diagnosis to refer for early intervention"
  - "Core deficits: Social communication + restricted/repetitive behaviors"
  - "Regression occurs in ~25% - always concerning"

key_history_questions:
  - "Eye contact? Response to name?"
  - "Does child point to show you things?"
  - "Pretend play? Interactive play with others?"
  - "Any words? Any loss of words or skills?"
  - "Repetitive behaviors or intense interests?"
  - "Sensory sensitivities?"
  - "Family history of ASD, language delays?"

  - "Observe: Eye contact, joint attention, response to name"
  - "Social reciprocity during play"
  - "Language: Echolalia, pronoun reversal, scripted speech"
  - "Repetitive movements (hand flapping, spinning)"
  - "Developmental milestones"
  - "Rule out hearing loss"

treatment_principles:
  - "Early intervention: Refer IMMEDIATELY upon suspicion"
  - "Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA): Evidence-based therapy"
  - "Speech therapy, occupational therapy"
  - "No medication for core symptoms - only for comorbidities"
  - "School: IEP with specialized supports"
  - "Parent training and support"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Refer to developmental pediatrics/neurology for formal diagnosis"
  - "Refer to Early Intervention (0-3) or school district (3+) immediately"
  - "Audiology: Rule out hearing loss"
