# Learning Disabilities - Teaching Framework
topic: "Specific Learning Disorders"
aliases: ["learning disability", "dyslexia", "dyscalculia", "dysgraphia", "LD"]
category: developmental
age_range_months: [60, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize warning signs of learning disabilities"
  - "Know evaluation is through school (not medical testing)"
  - "Understand comorbidity with ADHD"
  - "Advocate for appropriate accommodations"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering 'learning disability testing' in medical setting"
  - "Missing ADHD comorbidity (30-40% overlap)"
  - "Attributing LD to laziness or lack of effort"
  - "Not advocating for school evaluation"

red_flags:
  - "Reading significantly below grade level"
  - "Unexplained academic decline"
  - "Significant discrepancy between ability and achievement"
  - "School refusal secondary to academic struggles"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Specific LD: Dyslexia (reading), dyscalculia (math), dysgraphia (writing)"
  - "Diagnosis through PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL testing at school - not medical tests"
  - "Request evaluation in WRITING to trigger timeline requirements"
  - "IEP vs 504: IEP for specialized instruction; 504 for accommodations only"
  - "ADHD comorbidity: 30-40% have both - treat ADHD, it helps LD too"

key_history_questions:
  - "What grades? Which subjects are hardest?"
  - "Reading level? Math skills?"
  - "Writing difficulties?"
  - "Attention/focus issues? (ADHD screen)"
  - "Family history of learning problems?"
  - "Prior evaluations or services?"
  - "Anxiety or avoidance about school?"
  - "Strengths - what does child do well?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "General developmental assessment"
  - "Vision and hearing screening"
  - "ADHD screening (Vanderbilt, Conners)"
  - "Mental status, anxiety/depression screening"
  - "Neurologic exam (usually normal)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Request psychoeducational evaluation from school IN WRITING"
  - "IEP: If qualifies, includes specialized instruction"
  - "504 Plan: Accommodations (extra time, preferential seating)"
  - "Treat ADHD if present - improves academic function"
  - "Evidence-based reading interventions (Orton-Gillingham for dyslexia)"
  - "Assistive technology when appropriate"

disposition_guidance:
  - "School: Primary resource for evaluation and intervention"
  - "Request evaluation in writing → triggers legal timeline"
  - "Psychology: Private neuropsychological testing if school declines"
  - "Consider: Vision therapy, audiologic processing evaluation if indicated"
  - "Support: Advocacy organizations (Learning Disabilities Association)"
