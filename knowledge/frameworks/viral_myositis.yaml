# Viral Myositis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Benign Acute Childhood Myositis"
aliases: ["viral myositis", "post-influenza myositis", "calf pain after flu"]
category: musculoskeletal
age_range_months: [36, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic post-viral presentation"
  - "Distinguish from more serious causes"
  - "Know appropriate workup"
  - "Counsel on self-limited nature"
  - "Identify when further evaluation needed"

common_mistakes:
  - "Extensive workup for classic presentation"
  - "Missing compartment syndrome"
  - "Confusing with dermatomyositis or polymyositis"
  - "Not checking CK level"
  - "Missing rhabdomyolysis in severe cases"

red_flags:
  - "Dark urine (myoglobinuria/rhabdomyolysis)"
  - "CK > 10,000 (rhabdomyolysis risk)"
  - "Fever with muscle weakness (not just pain)"
  - "Progressive weakness"
  - "Rash (dermatomyositis)"
  - "Swallowing or breathing difficulty"
  - "Compartment syndrome signs"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic: school-age child, 1-7 days after influenza or viral URI"
  - "Bilateral calf pain and tenderness"
  - "Refuses to walk or walks on toes"
  - "Influenza B more common than A"
  - "Boys > girls"
  - "CK elevated (usually 1,000-10,000)"
  - "Self-limited: resolves in 3-7 days"
  - "Upper extremity involvement or weakness = think other diagnoses"

key_history_questions:
  - "Recent viral illness? Influenza?"
  - "When did leg pain start relative to illness?"
  - "Bilateral or unilateral?"
  - "Can they walk? How are they walking?"
  - "Any weakness (vs just pain)?"
  - "Dark urine?"
  - "Rash?"
  - "Fever still present?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Bilateral calf tenderness (classic)"
  - "Toe walking or refusal to walk"
  - "Full strength (pain-limited but no true weakness)"
  - "Full range of motion (pain-limited)"
  - "No rash"
  - "Compartments soft"
  - "Normal neurologic exam"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care"
  - "Rest and hydration"
  - "Pain control with NSAIDs or acetaminophen"
  - "Check CK - expect elevated"
  - "If CK very high (>10k): IV fluids, monitor renal function"
  - "Activity as tolerated"
  - "Should improve daily"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Classic presentation, CK < 10,000, well hydrated"
  - "Observation/admission: CK > 10,000, dark urine, unable to hydrate"
  - "Labs: CK, consider BMP (renal function) if concerned"
  - "Return: Dark urine, worsening pain, not improving in 3-5 days"
  - "Further workup: Progressive, unilateral, upper extremity, true weakness"
