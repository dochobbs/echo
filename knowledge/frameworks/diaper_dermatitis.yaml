# Diaper Dermatitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Diaper Dermatitis"
aliases: ["diaper rash", "nappy rash", "candidal diaper rash"]
category: derm
age_range_months: [0, 36]

teaching_goals:
  - "Differentiate irritant from candidal diaper dermatitis"
  - "Know barrier creams are first-line for irritant rash"
  - "Recognize when antifungal treatment is needed"
  - "Avoid inappropriate steroid use in diaper area"

common_mistakes:
  - "Using high-potency steroids in diaper area (thin skin, occlusion)"
  - "Missing satellite lesions indicating candida"
  - "Not counseling on diaper hygiene and frequent changes"
  - "Treating all diaper rash as candida"

red_flags:
  - "Erosions, ulceration (severe irritant or infection)"
  - "Persistent rash despite treatment (psoriasis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis)"
  - "Associated with failure to thrive (zinc deficiency, immunodeficiency)"
  - "Jacquet erosive dermatitis"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Irritant: Spares creases (convex surfaces affected) - barrier cream is treatment"
  - "Candida: INVOLVES creases + satellite pustules - needs antifungal"
  - "Zinc oxide paste: Barrier protection, apply liberally at each change"
  - "DO NOT use combination steroid/antifungal products in diaper area"

key_history_questions:
  - "How long has rash been present?"
  - "Recent antibiotics (predisposes to candida)?"
  - "Diaper changing frequency?"
  - "Type of diapers (cloth vs disposable)?"
  - "What products have been used?"
  - "Any diarrhea?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Distribution: Creases spared (irritant) vs creases involved (candida)"
  - "Satellite lesions (candida)"
  - "Beefy red, well-demarcated (candida)"
  - "Erosions or ulceration"
  - "Check for oral thrush (if candida suspected)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Irritant: Barrier cream (zinc oxide) + frequent diaper changes + air exposure"
  - "Candidal: Topical nystatin or clotrimazole + barrier cream"
  - "Low-potency steroid (hydrocortisone 1%): Brief course only if very inflamed"
  - "AVOID: High-potency steroids, combination products"
  - "Treat oral thrush if present (source of reinfection)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Follow-up: If not improving in 1 week"
  - "Dermatology: Refractory, erosive, or atypical presentation"
