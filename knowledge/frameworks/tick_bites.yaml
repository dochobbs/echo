# Tick Bites - Teaching Framework
topic: "Tick Bites and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention"
aliases: ["tick bite", "tick removal", "tick prophylaxis"]
category: environmental
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know proper tick removal technique"
  - "Understand Lyme prophylaxis indications"
  - "Recognize when testing is and isn't indicated"
  - "Counsel on prevention"
  - "Know tick-borne diseases in your region"

common_mistakes:
  - "Using folk remedies for removal (petroleum jelly, heat)"
  - "Giving prophylaxis for all tick bites"
  - "Sending tick for testing (rarely helpful)"
  - "Testing patient immediately after bite (too early)"
  - "Missing attached tick during exam"

red_flags:
  - "Erythema migrans (expanding rash >5cm)"
  - "Fever, headache, myalgias after tick bite"
  - "Facial palsy"
  - "Signs of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (petechial rash, high fever)"
  - "Multiple tick bites"
  - "Tick attached > 36 hours"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Proper removal: fine-tipped tweezers, grasp close to skin, pull straight up"
  - "Don't squeeze, twist, or burn the tick"
  - "Local reaction at bite site is normal (doesn't mean Lyme)"
  - "Erythema migrans: expanding, usually > 5cm, central clearing classic"
  - "Lyme prophylaxis: only if high-risk criteria met"
  - "Prophylaxis criteria: Ixodes tick, attached ≥36h, endemic area, within 72h"
  - "Doxycycline single dose: 4.4 mg/kg (max 200mg) for prophylaxis"
  - "Doxycycline safe in children < 8 for short courses"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did you find the tick?"
  - "How long was it attached (estimate)?"
  - "Where were you (geographic location)?"
  - "Was tick engorged?"
  - "How was tick removed?"
  - "Any part of tick left in skin?"
  - "Any symptoms: fever, rash, headache?"
  - "When was the bite (within 72 hours for prophylaxis)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Identify bite site"
  - "Retained tick parts (rare if properly removed)"
  - "Local reaction (small, non-expanding erythema is normal)"
  - "Expanding erythema > 5cm (erythema migrans)"
  - "Complete skin exam for other ticks or rashes"
  - "Lymphadenopathy"
  - "Signs of systemic illness"

treatment_principles:
  - "Remove tick properly if still attached"
  - "Clean bite site with soap and water"
  - "Prophylaxis (doxycycline) if ALL criteria met:"
  - "  - Ixodes scapularis (deer tick) identified"
  - "  - Attached ≥ 36 hours (or engorged)"
  - "  - Endemic area for Lyme"
  - "  - Within 72 hours of removal"
  - "Doxycycline 4.4 mg/kg x 1 dose (max 200mg)"
  - "No prophylaxis needed for most tick bites"
  - "Observation: watch for rash or symptoms x 30 days"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All tick bites"
  - "Prophylaxis: Only if criteria met, can be given in office"
  - "No testing: Tick testing not recommended, patient testing too early"
  - "Return: Expanding rash, fever, headache, myalgias in next 30 days"
  - "Treat: If erythema migrans develops, full Lyme treatment (not just prophylaxis)"
  - "Prevention: DEET, permethrin on clothes, daily tick checks"
