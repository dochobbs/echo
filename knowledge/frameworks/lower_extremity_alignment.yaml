# Lower Extremity Alignment - Teaching Framework
topic: "Lower Extremity Alignment"
aliases: ["bowlegs", "knock-knees", "intoeing", "genu varum", "genu valgum", "metatarsus adductus"]
category: msk
age_range_months: [0, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know normal physiologic progression of lower extremity alignment"
  - "Distinguish physiologic from pathologic bowing/knock-knees"
  - "Recognize when to refer vs reassure"
  - "Understand intoeing causes by age"

common_mistakes:
  - "Referring physiologic bowlegs in toddlers"
  - "Recommending special shoes (don't change outcome)"
  - "Missing Blount's disease in older/heavier child"
  - "Over-treating metatarsus adductus (most resolve)"

red_flags:
  - "Unilateral or asymmetric bowing"
  - "Short stature (rickets, skeletal dysplasia)"
  - "Progressive deformity after age 2"
  - "Genu varum persisting beyond age 3"
  - "Lateral thrust with walking"
  - "History of rickets, renal disease"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Normal progression: Bowlegs at birth → straight by 2 → knock-knees by 3-4 → straighten by 7-8"
  - "Physiologic genu varum: Symmetric, improving, no lateral thrust, normal growth"
  - "Blount disease: Pathologic - persists after age 2, obese, unilateral or asymmetric"
  - "Intoeing causes: Metatarsus adductus (<1yr), internal tibial torsion (1-3yr), femoral anteversion (3-8yr)"
  - "Special shoes, orthotics do NOT change natural history"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did parents first notice? Getting better or worse?"
  - "Any family history of similar issues?"
  - "Any tripping or functional problems?"
  - "Any pain?"
  - "Growth history - is child growing normally?"
  - "Diet history (vitamin D, calcium intake)?"
  - "Any known bone or kidney problems?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Observe gait - lateral thrust? Intoeing?"
  - "Measure intercondylar or intermalleolar distance"
  - "Symmetric vs asymmetric"
  - "Height - plot on growth chart"
  - "Thigh-foot angle (tibial torsion)"
  - "Hip rotation (femoral anteversion = increased internal rotation)"
  - "Foot shape (metatarsus adductus - medial border convex)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Physiologic bowlegs/knock-knees: Observation and reassurance"
  - "Metatarsus adductus: Observe if flexible (90% resolve by age 4-6)"
  - "Internal tibial torsion: Resolves spontaneously by age 4-5"
  - "Femoral anteversion: Improves spontaneously until age 8-10"
  - "Special shoes and braces: Do NOT work - save parents money"
  - "Referral: Asymmetric, progressive, or persisting beyond expected age"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Reassurance: Physiologic variants within expected age"
  - "X-ray: If asymmetric, progressive, or outside expected age range"
  - "Orthopedics: Blount disease, progressive deformity, suspected rickets"
  - "Labs (vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, ALP): If rickets suspected"
  - "Follow-up: Observe serially if near edge of normal"
