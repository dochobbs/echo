# Short Stature - Teaching Framework
topic: "Short Stature"
aliases: ["short stature", "growth failure", "failure to grow", "growth delay"]
category: endocrine
age_range_months: [24, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Differentiate normal variants from pathologic causes"
  - "Know how to calculate mid-parental height"
  - "Recognize when growth failure indicates serious disease"
  - "Order appropriate initial workup"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not plotting growth velocity (more important than single height)"
  - "Missing hypothyroidism or celiac disease"
  - "Not obtaining bone age"
  - "Reassuring without appropriate workup"

red_flags:
  - "Crossing growth percentiles (declining velocity)"
  - "Height significantly below mid-parental target"
  - "Disproportionate body segments (skeletal dysplasia)"
  - "Dysmorphic features"
  - "Delayed puberty with short stature"
  - "Associated symptoms (headache, vision changes)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Normal variants: Familial short stature (short parents, normal velocity) and Constitutional delay (bone age delayed, late puberty, catch-up later)"
  - "Mid-parental height: (Mom height + Dad height +/- 13cm) / 2; target range +/- 8.5cm"
  - "Growth velocity more important than absolute height - crossing percentiles is concerning"
  - "Bone age: Delayed in constitutional delay and some endocrine disorders; normal in familial short stature"
  - "Common pathologic causes: Hypothyroidism, celiac disease, GH deficiency, Turner syndrome (girls)"

key_history_questions:
  - "Birth history: Weight, length, gestational age?"
  - "Parent heights?"
  - "Family history of late bloomers?"
  - "Age of parent's puberty?"
  - "Chronic illness? Medications?"
  - "Diet, appetite?"
  - "GI symptoms (celiac screen)?"
  - "Fatigue, cold intolerance (thyroid)?"
  - "Headaches, vision changes (pituitary)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Height, weight, BMI on growth curve"
  - "Calculate growth velocity (need 2 points over 6+ months)"
  - "Calculate mid-parental target height"
  - "Body proportions (arm span, upper/lower segment ratio)"
  - "Dysmorphic features (Turner, skeletal dysplasia)"
  - "Tanner staging"
  - "Thyroid exam"
  - "Visual fields if pituitary suspected"

treatment_principles:
  - "Familial short stature: Reassurance - no treatment needed"
  - "Constitutional delay: Reassurance; optional short course sex steroids"
  - "Treat underlying cause if pathologic (hypothyroidism, celiac, etc.)"
  - "Growth hormone: Only if GH deficiency proven"
  - "Turner syndrome: GH + estrogen replacement"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Initial labs: CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac panel (tTG-IgA), IGF-1, +/- karyotype (girls)"
  - "Bone age: Essential first step"
  - "Endocrinology referral: Pathologic cause suspected, GH deficiency, declining velocity"
  - "Genetics: Dysmorphic features, disproportionate"
  - "Brain MRI: If GH deficiency confirmed or neurologic symptoms"
