# Burns - Teaching Framework
topic: "Burns"
aliases: ["burn injury", "scald burn", "thermal injury"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Accurately estimate burn depth and TBSA"
  - "Know criteria for burn center referral"
  - "Recognize non-accidental trauma patterns"
  - "Manage minor burns in office"

common_mistakes:
  - "Overestimating burn degree initially (edema obscures depth)"
  - "Not considering NAT with concerning patterns"
  - "Under-resuscitating fluid for significant burns"
  - "Using ice on burns (causes more damage)"

red_flags:
  - "Circumferential burns (compartment syndrome risk)"
  - "Inhalation injury (singed nasal hairs, soot, stridor)"
  - "Burns to face, hands, feet, genitals, joints"
  - "Electrical or chemical burns"
  - "Pattern suggesting NAT (stocking/glove, immersion line, cigarette)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "TBSA: Child's palm = 1% TBSA; use modified Lund-Browder for accuracy"
  - "Depth: 1st (red, painful, no blister) → 2nd (blister, painful) → 3rd (white/charred, painless)"
  - "NAT patterns: Immersion burns (clear line), symmetric, protected areas, inconsistent story"
  - "Cool running water x 20 minutes for acute burns (not ice!)"
  - "Burn center: >10% TBSA, full-thickness, face/hands/feet/genitals/joints, inhalation, NAT"

key_history_questions:
  - "What caused the burn? Hot liquid, flame, chemical, electrical?"
  - "When did it happen?"
  - "What first aid was given?"
  - "Is the story consistent with the burn pattern?"
  - "Who was supervising?"
  - "Tetanus immunization status?"
  - "Past medical history (diabetes, immunocompromised)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "TBSA calculation (palm = 1% or Lund-Browder)"
  - "Depth assessment (may evolve over 48-72 hours)"
  - "Location (high-risk areas)"
  - "Circumferential? (Risk of compartment syndrome)"
  - "Airway: Voice changes, stridor, singed hairs, soot"
  - "Pattern concerning for NAT"

treatment_principles:
  - "First aid: Cool running water 20 min, remove clothing/jewelry, cover loosely"
  - "Minor burns (<5% TBSA, superficial): Clean, antibiotic ointment, non-adherent dressing"
  - "No ice, no butter, no home remedies"
  - "Pain control: Acetaminophen, ibuprofen; oral opioids if severe"
  - "Fluid resuscitation: >10% TBSA - Parkland formula (4 mL/kg/% TBSA LR over 24h)"
  - "Tetanus update if needed"
  - "Silvadene for partial thickness (not on face)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Burn center: >10% TBSA, 3rd degree, face/hands/feet/genitals/joints, circumferential, inhalation, electrical, chemical, NAT"
  - "ED: >5% TBSA, full thickness, high-risk location"
  - "Home: <5% TBSA superficial/partial thickness, low-risk location"
  - "Follow-up: 24-48 hours for wound check"
  - "Report NAT to child protective services"
