# Skin Abscess - Teaching Framework
topic: "Skin Abscess"
aliases: ["boil", "furuncle", "carbuncle", "I&D", "abscess drainage"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish abscess from cellulitis"
  - "Know when incision and drainage is needed"
  - "Understand role of antibiotics with I&D"
  - "Recognize MRSA and risk factors"
  - "Perform basic I&D technique"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating abscess with antibiotics alone (needs drainage)"
  - "Incising too early before fluctuance"
  - "Inadequate incision for drainage"
  - "Not breaking up loculations"
  - "Routine cultures in simple abscess"

red_flags:
  - "Periorbital, perirectal, or hand abscess"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"
  - "Signs of systemic infection (fever, tachycardia)"
  - "Rapidly spreading cellulitis"
  - "Concern for necrotizing fasciitis"
  - "Failed outpatient I&D"
  - "Deep or large abscess requiring OR"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Fluctuance = fluid collection = needs drainage"
  - "I&D is the treatment - antibiotics alone don't work"
  - "Antibiotics after I&D: debated, consider if surrounding cellulitis"
  - "CA-MRSA common cause - TMP-SMX or doxycycline if antibiotics used"
  - "Packing controversial - evidence mixed, may not be needed"
  - "Warm compresses can help small abscesses drain spontaneously"
  - "Recurrent abscesses: consider decolonization, check glucose"

key_history_questions:
  - "How long has it been there?"
  - "Getting bigger?"
  - "Any fever?"
  - "Previous similar infections?"
  - "Anyone else at home with skin infections?"
  - "Diabetes or immune problems?"
  - "Recent antibiotics?"
  - "Insect bite or injury before this?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Fluctuance (key finding)"
  - "Erythema, warmth, tenderness"
  - "Surrounding cellulitis"
  - "Point of maximal fluctuance"
  - "Regional lymphadenopathy"
  - "Fever"
  - "Location (face, hand, perirectal = higher risk)"

treatment_principles:
  - "I&D is primary treatment if fluctuant"
  - "Anesthesia: local infiltration around abscess"
  - "Linear incision over fluctuant area"
  - "Break up loculations with hemostat"
  - "Irrigate cavity"
  - "Packing optional (no clear benefit in evidence)"
  - "Antibiotics: TMP-SMX or doxycycline if cellulitis, immunocompromised"
  - "Wound care: keep clean, warm compresses, follow-up for packing removal"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Simple abscess with successful I&D"
  - "Referral: Periorbital, hand, perirectal abscess"
  - "ED/OR: Large or deep abscess, failed I&D, systemic illness"
  - "Return in 48 hours for recheck/packing change"
  - "Decolonization: Recurrent infections - mupirocin nares, chlorhexidine washes"

parent_styles: [anxious, MRSA-fearful, frustrated-by-recurrence]
