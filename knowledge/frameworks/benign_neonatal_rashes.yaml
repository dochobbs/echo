  - "Pustules with surrounding cellulitis"
  - "Ill-appearing infant with rash"
  - "Petechiae or purpura"

clinical_pearls:

  - "Transient Pustular Melanosis: Pustules AT BIRTH, rupture leaving pigmented freckle with collarette of scale"
  - "Milia: 'Whiteheads' on nose - keratin cysts. Do NOT pick/pop"
  - "All resolve spontaneously - reassurance is the treatment"
