# Lyme Disease - Teaching Framework
topic: "Lyme Disease"
aliases: ["Lyme", "erythema migrans", "tick-borne illness"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize erythema migrans as clinical diagnosis"
  - "Know doxycycline is safe for short courses in children"
  - "Understand when prophylaxis is indicated"
  - "Avoid overtesting with serology early"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering serology for erythema migrans (will be negative early)"
  - "Avoiding doxycycline in children <8 years (safe for <21 days)"
  - "Missing prophylaxis opportunity for high-risk tick bites"
  - "Treating every tick bite regardless of risk factors"

red_flags:
  - "Facial palsy (Lyme cranial neuritis)"
  - "Heart block (Lyme carditis)"
  - "Meningitis symptoms"
  - "Arthritis (late manifestation)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Erythema Migrans: CLINICAL diagnosis - do NOT order serology (negative early)"
  - "Doxycycline is SAFE for children <8y for <21 days (no tooth staining)"
  - "Doxycycline is preferred treatment for all ages"
  - "Prophylaxis: Single-dose doxycycline if tick attached >36h, engorged, prevalence >20%"

key_history_questions:
  - "Known tick bite? When removed?"
  - "How long was tick attached? Engorged?"
  - "Geographic location of exposure?"
  - "Rash - when appeared, expanding?"
  - "Fever, fatigue, arthralgias?"
  - "Any facial weakness or palpitations?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Erythema migrans (expanding red ring, may have central clearing)"
  - "Size and location of rash"
  - "Facial nerve exam"
  - "Joint exam"
  - "Cardiac exam"
  - "Neurologic exam"

treatment_principles:
  - "Early Lyme: Doxycycline 4.4 mg/kg/day divided BID x 10-14 days"
  - "Alternatives: Amoxicillin, Cefuroxime"
  - "Prophylaxis: Single dose doxycycline 4.4 mg/kg (max 200mg)"
  - "Disseminated: Longer course, may need IV"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Early localized Lyme disease"
  - "Cardiology/Neuro consult: Heart block, meningitis, facial palsy"
  - "Admit: Severe carditis, CNS involvement"
