# Pediatric Fractures - Teaching Framework
topic: "Pediatric Fractures"
aliases: ["broken bone", "fracture", "buckle fracture", "greenstick", "Salter-Harris"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize pediatric-specific fracture patterns"
  - "Understand Salter-Harris classification"
  - "Know which fractures need urgent orthopedic referral"
  - "Identify non-accidental trauma patterns"
  - "Provide appropriate immobilization"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing Salter-Harris I fracture (normal X-ray)"
  - "Not considering NAT with certain patterns"
  - "Over-treating buckle fractures"
  - "Missing plastic deformation injuries"
  - "Not assessing neurovascular status"

red_flags:
  - "Open fracture"
  - "Neurovascular compromise"
  - "Compartment syndrome signs (pain with passive stretch)"
  - "Fracture inconsistent with history (NAT)"
  - "Multiple fractures in different stages of healing"
  - "Supracondylar fracture (vascular injury risk)"
  - "Femur fracture in non-ambulatory child"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Buckle (torus): compression of cortex, stable, splint only"
  - "Greenstick: incomplete break, one cortex intact"
  - "Plastic deformation: bent bone without fracture line"
  - "Salter-Harris: involves growth plate - SALTR mnemonic"
  - "SH-I: Slipped - through physis, X-ray may be normal"
  - "SH-II: Above - through physis and metaphysis (most common)"
  - "SH-III: Lower - through physis and epiphysis"
  - "SH-IV: Through all - through metaphysis, physis, epiphysis"
  - "SH-V: Rammed/crushed - compression of physis (worst prognosis)"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism of injury?"
  - "Witnessed or unwitnessed?"
  - "Able to use extremity after?"
  - "Swelling - immediate or delayed?"
  - "Developmental stage (ambulatory, crawling)?"
  - "History consistent with injury pattern?"
  - "Previous fractures?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Deformity"
  - "Swelling and ecchymosis"
  - "Point tenderness"
  - "Range of motion (if tolerated)"
  - "Neurovascular status (pulses, cap refill, sensation, motor)"
  - "Growth plate tenderness"
  - "Skin integrity (open vs closed)"
  - "Compartments (firm, pain with passive stretch)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Immobilize in position of comfort"
  - "Ice and elevation"
  - "Neurovascular checks before and after splinting"
  - "Buckle fracture: removable splint 3-4 weeks, ortho follow-up optional"
  - "Greenstick: reduction if angulated, casting"
  - "Salter-Harris II+: orthopedic referral"
  - "Open fracture: antibiotics, tetanus, urgent OR"
  - "Pain control appropriate to injury"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient with splint: Buckle fractures, non-displaced SH-I/II"
  - "Same-day orthopedics: Displaced fractures, SH-III/IV, angulated"
  - "ED/urgent: Open, neurovascular compromise, compartment syndrome"
  - "NAT evaluation: Inconsistent history, high-risk patterns, multiple injuries"
  - "Follow-up: All growth plate injuries need orthopedic follow-up"

parent_styles: [anxious, guilty, NAT-concern, seeking-reassurance]
