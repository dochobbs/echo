# Phimosis and Paraphimosis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Phimosis and Paraphimosis"
aliases: ["phimosis", "paraphimosis", "tight foreskin"]
category: urology
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish physiologic from pathologic phimosis"
  - "Recognize paraphimosis as emergency"
  - "Know when to refer vs reassure"
  - "Avoid premature retraction"

common_mistakes:
  - "Forcibly retracting foreskin in young child (causes scarring)"
  - "Missing paraphimosis (emergency)"
  - "Treating physiologic phimosis as pathologic"
  - "Not reducing paraphimosis promptly"

red_flags:
  - "Paraphimosis: Foreskin stuck behind glans with swelling (EMERGENCY)"
  - "Balanitis with obstructive voiding"
  - "Scarring (BXO/lichen sclerosus)"
  - "Recurrent UTIs with phimosis"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Physiologic phimosis: Normal! Only 4% of newborns retractable; 90% by age 3, 99% by age 17"
  - "Do NOT forcibly retract - causes adhesions and scarring"
  - "Pathologic phimosis: Scarred (whitish ring), causing symptoms"
  - "Paraphimosis: Foreskin stuck behind glans - REDUCE immediately or necrosis occurs"
  - "Topical steroids: First-line for pathologic phimosis (0.05% betamethasone BID x 4-6 weeks)"

key_history_questions:
  - "Can foreskin retract at all?"
  - "Any difficulty urinating? Ballooning?"
  - "Pain? Redness?"
  - "Previous attempts to retract?"
  - "Any forced retraction by caregiver or provider?"
  - "Recurrent infections?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Observe foreskin - scarring? (White ring at tip = BXO)"
  - "Gently assess retractability - DO NOT force"
  - "If paraphimosis: Swollen glans with tight foreskin band behind"
  - "Signs of balanitis (erythema, discharge)"
  - "Meatal stenosis"

treatment_principles:
  - "Physiologic phimosis: Reassurance - will resolve with time"
  - "Pathologic phimosis: Topical steroid (betamethasone 0.05%) BID x 4-6 weeks"
  - "Paraphimosis reduction: Steady pressure on glans, ice/sugar to reduce edema, pull foreskin forward"
  - "If reduction fails: Dorsal slit or circumcision (urology emergency)"
  - "Surgery: Reserved for steroid failure, BXO, recurrent paraphimosis"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Reassurance: Physiologic phimosis - no retraction needed"
  - "Topical steroids: For symptomatic pathologic phimosis"
  - "ED/urgent: Paraphimosis - needs immediate reduction"
  - "Urology referral: Steroid failure, BXO, recurrent balanitis, recurrent UTI"
  - "Counsel: Never forcibly retract foreskin in young child"

parent_styles: [worried-about-anatomy, wanting-circumcision, confused-about-care]
