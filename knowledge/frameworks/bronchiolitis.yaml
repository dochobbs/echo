# Bronchiolitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Bronchiolitis"
aliases: ["RSV bronchiolitis", "viral bronchiolitis"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [1, 24]
seasonality:
  peak_months: [11, 12, 1, 2, 3]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize clinical diagnosis - no testing needed in typical cases"
  - "Understand supportive care is the mainstay of treatment"
  - "Know what interventions DON'T work (bronchodilators, steroids)"
  - "Identify risk factors for severe disease"
  - "Apply appropriate disposition criteria"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering RSV testing in straightforward cases"
  - "Prescribing albuterol or steroids"
  - "Obtaining chest X-ray without specific indication"
  - "Underestimating feeding difficulty as severity marker"
  - "Discharging before observing adequate oral intake"

red_flags:
  - "Apnea (especially in young infants)"
  - "Respiratory rate >70"
  - "SpO2 <90% on room air"
  - "Severe retractions or nasal flaring"
  - "Poor feeding (<50% of normal)"
  - "Prematurity <32 weeks"
  - "Age <6 weeks"

clinical_pearls:
  - "AAP says: No albuterol, no steroids, no antibiotics, no chest X-ray"
  - "Suctioning + feeding support + O2 if needed = treatment"
  - "Illness peaks day 3-5, can take 2-3 weeks to fully resolve"
  - "Feeding difficulty is often the rate-limiting step for discharge"
  - "Palivizumab for high-risk infants is prevention, not treatment"

key_history_questions:
  - "How is feeding going? How much are they taking?"
  - "Wet diapers in past 24 hours?"
  - "Any pauses in breathing or color changes?"
  - "Prematurity? Gestational age?"
  - "Any chronic lung or heart disease?"
  - "Sick contacts?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Work of breathing (retractions, nasal flaring, grunting)"
  - "Respiratory rate"
  - "Oxygen saturation"
  - "Hydration status"
  - "Wheezing and/or crackles"
  - "Level of alertness"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care only"
  - "Nasal suctioning before feeds"
  - "Supplemental O2 to maintain SpO2 >90%"
  - "IV/NG fluids if not tolerating PO"
  - "No bronchodilators, no steroids, no antibiotics"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit if: O2 requirement, poor feeding, high-risk factors, apnea"
  - "Discharge if: Stable SpO2 on RA, feeding adequately, reliable follow-up"
  - "Peak illness 3-5 days - set expectations"

parent_styles: [anxious-first-time, experienced, sleep-deprived]
