# Nail Bed Injuries - Teaching Framework
topic: "Nail Bed Injuries"
aliases: ["subungual hematoma", "nail avulsion", "crushed finger", "smashed finger"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know when trephination is appropriate"
  - "Recognize injuries requiring nail bed repair"
  - "Identify associated distal phalanx fracture"
  - "Understand nail regrowth expectations"
  - "Know when hand surgery referral needed"

common_mistakes:
  - "Trephinating when nail bed repair is needed"
  - "Not obtaining X-ray (missing tuft fracture)"
  - "Replacing nail without repairing nail bed laceration"
  - "Over-treating simple subungual hematoma"
  - "Missing amputation/near-amputation"

red_flags:
  - "Nail avulsed with visible nail bed laceration"
  - "Amputation of fingertip"
  - "Open fracture"
  - "Severely displaced fracture"
  - "Significant loss of tissue"
  - "Tendon or joint involvement"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Subungual hematoma < 50% nail, intact nail and margins: trephination OK"
  - "Subungual hematoma > 50% or nail disrupted: remove nail, repair nail bed"
  - "Seymour fracture: open physeal fracture through nail bed - needs OR"
  - "Tuft fracture usually heals well with splint protection"
  - "Nail takes 3-6 months to fully regrow"
  - "Replace nail (or foil) to splint nail fold open during healing"
  - "Absorbable sutures (6-0 chromic) for nail bed repair"
  - "Children have excellent healing potential"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism - crush, laceration, saw?"
  - "When did it happen?"
  - "Any tissue loss?"
  - "Nail still attached?"
  - "Tetanus status?"
  - "Dominant hand?"
  - "Numbness?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Nail plate intact or disrupted"
  - "Size of subungual hematoma (percentage)"
  - "Nail fold margins intact"
  - "Visible nail bed laceration"
  - "DIP joint stability"
  - "Sensation distal to injury"
  - "Flexor and extensor function"
  - "Tissue viability"

treatment_principles:
  - "X-ray: Always - rule out fracture"
  - "Simple subungual hematoma (<50%, nail intact): trephination"
  - "Trephination: heated paper clip or cautery through nail"
  - "Large hematoma or nail disrupted: remove nail, repair bed"
  - "Nail bed repair: 6-0 absorbable suture under magnification"
  - "Replace cleaned nail (or foil) under nail fold as splint"
  - "Tuft fracture: protective splint 3-4 weeks"
  - "Antibiotics if open fracture"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Office/ED: Simple hematoma trephination, simple tuft fracture"
  - "Hand surgery: Nail bed laceration needing repair, complex injuries"
  - "Urgent hand surgery: Seymour fracture, amputation, replantation candidate"
  - "Splint protection: Tuft fractures, post-repair"
  - "Follow-up: 1 week wound check, longer for nail regrowth monitoring"
  - "Counsel: New nail may look different; takes months to regrow"
