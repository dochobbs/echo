# Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Urinary Tract Infection"
aliases: ["UTI", "bladder infection", "cystitis", "pyelonephritis"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [2, 24]

teaching_goals:
  - "Apply correct diagnostic criteria (pyuria AND culture)"
  - "Know limitations of bag urine specimens"
  - "Order appropriate imaging after first febrile UTI"
  - "Understand when VCUG is indicated"

common_mistakes:
  - "Diagnosing UTI from bag urine alone"
  - "Not requiring pyuria for diagnosis"
  - "Ordering VCUG for all first UTIs (only if US abnormal or recurrent)"
  - "Missing UTI in febrile infant without source"

red_flags:
  - "Febrile infant with no source"
  - "Recurrent UTIs"
  - "Abnormal renal ultrasound"
  - "Poor response to antibiotics"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Diagnostic criteria: Pyuria (WBCs) AND >50k CFU/mL culture"
  - "Bag urine is only good for RULING OUT (if negative)"
  - "Catheter or suprapubic aspiration required for diagnosis"
  - "RBUS for ALL febrile infants 2-24mo after first UTI"
  - "VCUG only if: US abnormal OR recurrent UTI"

key_history_questions:
  - "Fever - how high, how long?"
  - "Any urinary symptoms (older children)?"
  - "Previous UTIs?"
  - "Bowel habits - constipation?"
  - "Prenatal ultrasound - any kidney abnormalities?"
  - "Family history of vesicoureteral reflux?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Temperature"
  - "Abdominal exam (suprapubic/CVA tenderness)"
  - "Genital exam (circumcision status, labial adhesions)"
  - "Hydration status"

treatment_principles:
  - "Empiric antibiotics after proper urine collection"
  - "Oral antibiotics as effective as IV for uncomplicated"
  - "Duration: 7-14 days for febrile UTI"
  - "Follow-up culture not routinely needed if clinically improved"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Well-appearing, tolerating PO, reliable follow-up"
  - "Admit: Ill-appearing, unable to tolerate PO, very young infant"
  - "Imaging: RBUS for all first febrile UTI 2-24 months"
