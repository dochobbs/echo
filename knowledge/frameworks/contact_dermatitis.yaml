# Contact Dermatitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Contact Dermatitis"
aliases: ["allergic contact dermatitis", "poison ivy", "irritant dermatitis"]
category: derm
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish allergic from irritant contact dermatitis"
  - "Recognize poison ivy/oak pattern"
  - "Know when systemic steroids are indicated"
  - "Counsel on prevention and allergen avoidance"

common_mistakes:
  - "Using too weak a steroid for acute allergic contact dermatitis"
  - "Short course of oral steroids causing rebound"
  - "Missing nickel allergy (earrings, belt buckles, phone)"
  - "Not counseling on urushiol persistence on clothing/pets"

red_flags:
  - "Facial involvement with significant swelling"
  - "Genital involvement"
  - "Secondary bacterial infection"
  - "Airway involvement (inhaled smoke from burning poison ivy)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Poison ivy: Linear streaks are DIAGNOSTIC - urushiol spreads on skin contact"
  - "Rash does NOT spread from blister fluid - it's not contagious"
  - "Nickel: #1 contact allergen - look for belt buckle/jewelry pattern"
  - "Oral steroids for severe: 2-3 WEEKS taper to prevent rebound"

key_history_questions:
  - "What contacted the skin? When?"
  - "Any outdoor activities? New jewelry, soaps, cosmetics?"
  - "Is the rash spreading or stable?"
  - "Previous reactions to this substance?"
  - "What treatments have been tried?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Distribution pattern (linear = poison ivy, circular = nickel)"
  - "Vesicles, bullae in acute cases"
  - "Sharply demarcated borders"
  - "Erythema, edema, weeping"
  - "Signs of secondary infection"

treatment_principles:
  - "Mild/localized: High-potency topical steroid (triamcinolone, clobetasol)"
  - "Severe/widespread: Oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day"
  - "Taper over 2-3 WEEKS for poison ivy (short courses cause rebound)"
  - "Cool compresses, calamine for symptomatic relief"
  - "Barrier creams for prevention (before exposure)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "Allergist referral: Recurrent unexplained dermatitis, patch testing needed"
  - "Urgent: Severe facial/eyelid swelling, signs of infection"
  - "Follow-up: 1-2 weeks if on systemic steroids"
