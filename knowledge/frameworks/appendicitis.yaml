# Appendicitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Appendicitis"
aliases: ["acute appendicitis", "appy", "RLQ pain"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic presentation and atypical features"
  - "Know ultrasound is first-line imaging in pediatrics"
  - "Understand clinical scoring systems (Pediatric Appendicitis Score)"
  - "Avoid CT radiation when possible"

common_mistakes:
  - "Going straight to CT without ultrasound first"
  - "Missing early/atypical presentations"
  - "Reassured by 'normal' WBC early in course"
  - "Not considering appendicitis in young children"

red_flags:
  - "Signs of perforation (diffuse peritonitis, high fever)"
  - "Peritoneal signs"
  - "Prolonged symptoms (>48 hours) with worsening"
  - "Toxic appearance"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic progression: Periumbilical pain → RLQ pain + anorexia + vomiting"
  - "Pain BEFORE vomiting (opposite of gastroenteritis)"
  - "Ultrasound FIRST in children - avoid CT radiation"
  - "If US equivocal and high suspicion, MRI preferred over CT if available"
  - "Pediatric Appendicitis Score: Helps risk stratify"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did pain start? Where?"
  - "Has pain moved? (Migration to RLQ classic)"
  - "Vomiting? When relative to pain onset?"
  - "Appetite? (Anorexia very common)"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Last bowel movement? Diarrhea?"
  - "Able to walk, jump without pain?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "RLQ tenderness (McBurney's point)"
  - "Guarding, rigidity"
  - "Rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign"
  - "Psoas sign, obturator sign"
  - "Rectal exam rarely needed in typical presentation"
  - "Observe gait - limp, guarding when walking"

treatment_principles:
  - "NPO, IV fluids"
  - "Imaging: Ultrasound first, MRI if equivocal, CT if MRI unavailable"
  - "Surgical consultation"
  - "Uncomplicated: Appendectomy (laparoscopic)"
  - "Perforation with abscess: May be managed non-operatively initially"
  - "Antibiotics if perforated or delayed surgery"

disposition_guidance:
  - "ED referral: Suspected appendicitis"
  - "Surgical consult: All confirmed cases"
  - "Admit: For surgery or observation"
  - "Low suspicion: Can observe at home with strict return precautions"

parent_styles: [scared-about-surgery, wants-certainty, worried-about-pain]
