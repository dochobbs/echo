# Lacerations and Wound Care - Teaching Framework
topic: "Lacerations and Wound Care"
aliases: ["cuts", "wound", "laceration repair", "stitches"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Assess wounds for closure method"
  - "Know time limits for primary closure"
  - "Choose appropriate closure technique"
  - "Recognize wounds requiring specialist referral"
  - "Provide appropriate wound care instructions"

common_mistakes:
  - "Closing contaminated wounds primarily"
  - "Missing tendon or nerve injury"
  - "Inadequate wound exploration"
  - "Forgetting tetanus prophylaxis"
  - "Using tissue adhesive on high-tension areas"

red_flags:
  - "Arterial bleeding not controlled with pressure"
  - "Suspected tendon, nerve, or joint involvement"
  - "Open fracture"
  - "Bite wounds to hand or face"
  - "Heavily contaminated wounds"
  - "Signs of compartment syndrome"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Clean wounds: close within 12-24h (face up to 24h)"
  - "Contaminated wounds: 6h or less, consider delayed closure"
  - "Tissue adhesive: low-tension, clean, non-hair-bearing"
  - "Dermabond: don't get wet for 5 days"
  - "Sutures face: 5-7 days; scalp: 7-10; extremities: 10-14"
  - "LET gel (lidocaine-epi-tetracaine) great for kids before injection"
  - "Always check motor/sensory before anesthesia"

key_history_questions:
  - "What caused the injury? When?"
  - "Contamination (dirt, saliva, etc.)?"
  - "Tetanus immunization status?"
  - "Any numbness or weakness?"
  - "Can you move fingers/toes normally?"
  - "Foreign body possible?"
  - "Bleeding controlled with pressure?"
  - "Medical conditions affecting healing (diabetes)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Wound length, depth, location"
  - "Active bleeding vs controlled"
  - "Wound edges (clean vs ragged)"
  - "Contamination or foreign body"
  - "Neurovascular status distal to injury"
  - "Tendon function"
  - "Joint involvement (can see joint capsule)"
  - "Underlying bone or fracture"

treatment_principles:
  - "Irrigate copiously with saline"
  - "Explore wound for foreign body, depth"
  - "Check neurovascular and tendon function"
  - "Anesthesia: topical LET first, then infiltrate if needed"
  - "Closure options: sutures, staples, adhesive, steri-strips"
  - "Tetanus: if >5 years since booster (or >10 clean wound)"
  - "Antibiotics only for contaminated, bites, immunocompromised"
  - "Wound care: keep clean and dry, return for suture removal"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most simple lacerations"
  - "Specialist referral: Face (cosmetic), hand (tendons), eyelid, lip vermillion"
  - "ED/OR: Deep, arterial, tendon/nerve repair, open fracture"
  - "Delayed primary closure: Contaminated wounds"
  - "Follow-up: Suture removal per location, sooner if signs of infection"
