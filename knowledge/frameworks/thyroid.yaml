# Thyroid Disorders - Teaching Framework
topic: "Thyroid Disorders"
aliases: ["hypothyroidism", "hyperthyroidism", "thyroid disease", "Hashimoto's", "Graves disease"]
category: endocrine
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know newborn screening includes congenital hypothyroidism"
  - "Recognize acquired hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism"
  - "Understand Hashimoto's is most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism"
  - "Know Graves disease presentation and management"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not repeating abnormal newborn screen promptly"
  - "Missing subtle hypothyroidism symptoms (fatigue, constipation, weight gain)"
  - "Not checking TSH in child with goiter"
  - "Missing thyroid storm in severe Graves disease"

red_flags:
  - "Severe hyperthyroidism (thyroid storm): Fever, tachycardia, altered mental status"
  - "Compressive symptoms from goiter (dysphagia, stridor)"
  - "Thyroid nodule (evaluate for malignancy)"
  - "Neonatal hypothyroidism untreated (developmental delay)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Congenital hypothyroidism: Detected on newborn screen - treat by 2 weeks to prevent developmental delay"
  - "Hashimoto's: Most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism; TPO antibodies positive"
  - "Graves disease: Most common cause of hyperthyroidism; TSI antibodies positive"
  - "Hyperthyroid symptoms: Weight loss, heat intolerance, palpitations, tremor, anxiety, diarrhea"
  - "Hypothyroid symptoms: Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, delayed growth"

key_history_questions:
  - "Energy level? Fatigue?"
  - "Weight changes? Appetite changes?"
  - "Heat or cold intolerance?"
  - "Bowel habits (constipation vs diarrhea)?"
  - "Growth pattern?"
  - "Menstrual irregularities?"
  - "Anxiety, tremor, palpitations?"
  - "Family history of thyroid disease?"
  - "Any neck swelling or mass?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Thyroid exam: Size, nodules, tenderness"
  - "Heart rate, blood pressure"
  - "Skin (dry vs moist, warm)"
  - "Reflexes (sluggish vs brisk)"
  - "Tremor"
  - "Eye exam: Proptosis, lid lag (Graves)"
  - "Growth velocity"
  - "Pubertal status"

treatment_principles:
  - "Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine replacement; dose by weight in children"
  - "Congenital hypothyroidism: Start levothyroxine immediately (by 2 weeks of life)"
  - "Graves disease: Methimazole first-line; beta-blocker for symptom control"
  - "Graves: Definitive therapy = RAI or surgery if antithyroid medication fails"
  - "Monitor: TSH and free T4 every 4-6 weeks during titration"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Urgent: Abnormal newborn screen (congenital hypothyroidism) - refer immediately"
  - "Endocrinology: All Graves disease, thyroid nodules, complex cases"
  - "Labs: TSH first; if abnormal, add free T4, +/- T3, antibodies"
  - "ED: Thyroid storm, severe hyperthyroidism"
  - "Ultrasound: Thyroid nodules, goiter"
