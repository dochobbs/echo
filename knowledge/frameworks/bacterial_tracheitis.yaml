# Bacterial Tracheitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Bacterial Tracheitis"
aliases: ["pseudomembranous croup", "bacterial croup", "membranous laryngotracheobronchitis"]
category: respiratory
age_range_months: [6, 96]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish from viral croup"
  - "Recognize as airway emergency"
  - "Know typical pathogens and treatment"
  - "Understand need for ICU/airway management"
  - "Identify when to suspect this diagnosis"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating as simple croup when not responding"
  - "Delayed recognition of airway emergency"
  - "Not involving ENT/anesthesia early"
  - "Inadequate antibiotic coverage"
  - "Missing in child with 'croup not responding to treatment'"

red_flags:
  - "High fever with stridor"
  - "Toxic appearance"
  - "Not responding to croup treatment"
  - "Rapidly progressive airway symptoms"
  - "Thick purulent secretions"
  - "Increasing work of breathing despite treatment"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Average age 4-5 years (older than typical croup)"
  - "Often follows viral URI or croup"
  - "High fever + stridor + toxic = think bacterial tracheitis"
  - "S. aureus most common (including MRSA)"
  - "Also: Strep, H. flu, Moraxella"
  - "Subglottic narrowing with irregular margins/pseudomembranes"
  - "May need bronchoscopy for diagnosis and debridement"
  - "Higher intubation rate than croup"

key_history_questions:
  - "How did this start? Preceding croup or URI?"
  - "Fever - how high?"
  - "Stridor - at rest?"
  - "Any treatment for croup given? Response?"
  - "Getting better or worse?"
  - "Drooling or difficulty swallowing?"
  - "How does child look - playful or sick?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Toxic appearance (unlike most croup)"
  - "High fever"
  - "Stridor (inspiratory or biphasic)"
  - "Barky cough with thick secretions"
  - "Increased work of breathing"
  - "May have voice changes"
  - "NOT typically drooling (vs epiglottitis)"
  - "Can tolerate lying flat (vs epiglottitis)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Airway is priority - prepare for potential intubation"
  - "Humidified oxygen"
  - "Nebulized epinephrine"
  - "Dexamethasone (as for croup)"
  - "IV antibiotics: cover S. aureus (including MRSA), strep"
  - "Options: vancomycin + ceftriaxone, or ampicillin-sulbactam + vanc"
  - "ENT/pulmonology: may need bronchoscopy for debridement"
  - "ICU admission typically required"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit all: PICU or monitored bed"
  - "Early ENT and anesthesia involvement"
  - "Bronchoscopy: diagnostic and therapeutic"
  - "Intubation: significant percentage require"
  - "Duration antibiotics: typically 10-14 days"
  - "Prognosis: excellent with appropriate treatment"
