# Finger Injuries - Teaching Framework
topic: "Finger Injuries"
aliases: ["jammed finger", "mallet finger", "jersey finger", "finger sprain"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [60, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish sprain from more serious injury"
  - "Recognize mallet and jersey finger"
  - "Know which injuries need splinting vs surgery"
  - "Identify fractures requiring reduction"
  - "Understand buddy taping and splinting"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing mallet finger (droopy DIP)"
  - "Missing jersey finger (can't flex DIP)"
  - "Calling all jammed fingers 'sprains'"
  - "Not examining tendon function"
  - "Inadequate splinting duration for mallet finger"

red_flags:
  - "Unable to flex DIP (jersey finger - needs surgery)"
  - "Open fracture"
  - "Rotational deformity"
  - "Significantly displaced fracture"
  - "PIP dislocation that won't reduce"
  - "Vascular compromise"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Mallet finger: forced flexion of extended DIP - extensor tendon rupture"
  - "Mallet: unable to actively extend DIP (can passively extend)"
  - "Jersey finger: grabbed jersey, forced extension of flexed DIP - FDP rupture"
  - "Jersey: unable to flex DIP against resistance - needs surgery"
  - "Jammed finger: usually PIP sprain, check for fracture"
  - "Buddy tape: immobilize with adjacent finger"
  - "Mallet splint: DIP in extension 6-8 weeks continuously"
  - "If mallet splint removed and droops, restart clock"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism - ball strike, pulling, hyperextension?"
  - "Which joint hurts most?"
  - "Can you bend and straighten all joints?"
  - "Which sport/activity?"
  - "Dominant hand?"
  - "Previous finger injuries?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Swelling location"
  - "Active ROM at each joint (DIP, PIP, MCP)"
  - "Passive ROM"
  - "FDP function: hold PIP extended, ask to flex DIP"
  - "Extensor function: can extend DIP fully?"
  - "Rotational alignment (look at fingernails with fingers flexed)"
  - "Collateral ligament stability"
  - "Volar plate tenderness"

treatment_principles:
  - "X-ray: All significant finger injuries"
  - "Jammed finger (sprain): buddy tape 2-4 weeks, ice, NSAIDs"
  - "Mallet finger: DIP splint in extension 6-8 weeks full time"
  - "  Must not flex DIP at all during treatment (restarts clock)"
  - "Jersey finger: urgent hand surgery referral (tendon repair)"
  - "PIP dislocation: reduce, check stability, buddy tape"
  - "Fractures: splint, many can be buddy taped if stable"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Sprains, stable fractures, mallet finger"
  - "Hand surgery referral: Jersey finger, unstable fractures, open injuries"
  - "Urgent hand surgery: Jersey finger (sooner is better for repair)"
  - "Mallet finger: Stack splint, strict compliance counseling"
  - "Return for mallet: If splint comes off and DIP droops, restart 6-8 weeks"
  - "Sports return: After full ROM and strength, sport-specific protection"
