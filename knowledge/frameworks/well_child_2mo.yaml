    - "Lifts head when on tummy (45-degree angle or higher)"
    - "Moves both arms and both legs equally"
    - "Beginning to push up on forearms during tummy time"
  fine_motor:
    - "Opens hands briefly (hands no longer tightly fisted)"
    - "Holds objects placed in hand momentarily (reflexive grasp)"
  language:
    - "Makes cooing sounds (vowel-like 'oo', 'ah')"
    - "Turns head toward sounds"
  social_emotional:
    - "Smiles in response to being spoken to or smiled at (social smile)"
    - "Calms when spoken to or picked up"
    - "Looks at parent's face; briefly regards caregiver"
  cognitive:
    - "Watches you as you move (visual tracking past midline)"
    - "Looks at a toy for several seconds (beginning visual fixation)"
    - "Begins to show boredom if activity does not change (fussing, looking away)"

screening_tools:
  - tool: "Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)"
    when: "routine"
  - tool: "Developmental surveillance (clinical observation)"
    when: "routine"
  - tool: "ASQ-3 (Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd Ed)"
    when: "if concern"

anticipatory_guidance:
  safety:
    - "Back to sleep for every sleep -- supine position on a firm, flat surface with no loose bedding, pillows, bumpers, or soft toys"
    - "Rear-facing car seat in the back seat; ensure proper harness fit (chest clip at armpit level)"
    - "Never shake a baby -- discuss Period of PURPLE Crying and coping strategies for caregiver frustration"
    - "Water temperature less than 120 F (48 C) to prevent scald burns"
    - "Never leave infant unattended on elevated surfaces (changing tables, beds, couches)"
    - "Keep small objects, plastic bags, and cords out of reach"
  nutrition:
    - "Exclusive breastfeeding or iron-fortified formula for the first 6 months"
    - "Breastfed infants: vitamin D supplementation 400 IU daily starting in first few days of life"
    - "Feeding frequency: 8-12 times per day for breastfed, every 3-4 hours for formula-fed"
    - "Expected intake: approximately 4-5 oz per feeding for formula-fed infants"
    - "No cereal in bottles, no introduction of solids until 4-6 months"
    - "Assess latch, milk supply, and any breastfeeding difficulties; refer to lactation support if needed"
  development:
    - "Tummy time: at least 3-5 sessions daily while awake and supervised, working up to 15-30 minutes total"
    - "Talk, read, and sing to infant frequently to promote language development"
    - "Provide high-contrast toys and objects for visual stimulation"
    - "Respond to coos and smiles -- reciprocal interaction supports social-emotional growth"
    - "No screen time for children under 2 years (except video chatting)"
  behavior:
    - "Discuss normal fussiness and peak crying period (typically peaks at 6-8 weeks, improving by 3-4 months)"
    - "Soothing techniques: swaddling (arms-in until rolling), shushing, swinging, sucking, side/stomach position while held"
    - "Recognizing hunger cues vs other fussiness (rooting, lip smacking, hand to mouth)"
    - "Encourage responsive parenting -- cannot spoil an infant by responding to cries"
  sleep:
    - "Total sleep: 14-17 hours per 24-hour period"
    - "Nighttime stretches may lengthen to 4-6 hours; some infants still wake every 2-3 hours"
    - "Room-sharing without bed-sharing recommended for at least the first 6 months"
    - "Begin establishing a bedtime routine (dim lights, quiet activities, consistent timing)"
    - "Swaddling is appropriate until signs of rolling emerge; then transition to sleep sack"

immunizations_due:
  - vaccine: "Hepatitis B (HepB)"

    cvx: 116
    dose_number: "1st dose"
    notes: "Oral vaccine, 3-dose series (RV5). First dose must be given before 15 weeks 0 days of age. Do not restart or readminister if infant spits up."
  - vaccine: "Rotavirus (RV1 - Rotarix)"
    cvx: 119

  - vaccine: "Inactivated Poliovirus (IPV)"
    cvx: 10
    dose_number: "1st dose"
    notes: "Intramuscular. 4-dose series (2, 4, 6-18 months, 4-6 years). Combination vaccines (Pediarix, Vaxelis) may reduce injection count."

physical_exam_focus:
  - area: "Anterior fontanelle"
    detail: "Assess size (typically 2-3 cm at 2 months), fullness, and pulsation. Should be soft and flat in upright position."
    teaching_point: "A bulging fontanelle (especially when upright and calm) suggests elevated intracranial pressure. A sunken fontanelle may indicate dehydration. Premature closure raises concern for craniosynostosis."
  - area: "Red reflex"
    detail: "Bilateral simultaneous red reflex with direct ophthalmoscope at 12-18 inches. Should be symmetric, bright red-orange bilaterally."
    teaching_point: "Absent or white reflex (leukocoria) is an emergency -- must rule out retinoblastoma, congenital cataract, or other intraocular pathology. Asymmetric reflex may suggest strabismus."
  - area: "Hip examination (Barlow and Ortolani)"
    detail: "Ortolani: abduct flexed hips, feel for a 'clunk' as a dislocated hip reduces. Barlow: adduct flexed hip with gentle posterior pressure, feel for subluxation out of the acetabulum."
    teaching_point: "DDH is most reliably detected in the first 2-3 months. Risk factors include breech presentation, family history, female sex, firstborn. Asymmetric thigh folds or leg length discrepancy are additional clues. Refer for hip ultrasound if abnormal."
  - area: "Cardiac auscultation"
    detail: "Listen in all four positions (aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, mitral) with infant calm. Assess rate, rhythm, and presence of murmurs."
    teaching_point: "Innocent murmurs (Still's, pulmonary flow) are common and benign. Red flags for pathologic murmur: diastolic timing, harsh or blowing quality, grade 3+, associated symptoms (poor feeding, tachypnea, diaphoresis with feeds, cyanosis), or absent femoral pulses (coarctation)."
  - area: "Growth parameters"
    detail: "Plot weight, length, and head circumference on WHO growth charts (used for ages 0-24 months). Calculate weight-for-length percentile."
    teaching_point: "At 2 months, expect weight gain of approximately 20-30 g/day (about 1 oz/day). Crossing 2 or more major percentile lines (up or down) warrants investigation. Head circumference crossing percentiles upward may indicate hydrocephalus."
  - area: "Skin"
    detail: "Examine for birthmarks, rashes, signs of trauma. Note infantile hemangiomas, Mongolian spots, erythema toxicum (if residual), or eczema."
    teaching_point: "Infantile hemangiomas proliferate in first 3-5 months -- document size and location. Periocular, nasal tip, or segmental hemangiomas may require early referral. Multiple hemangiomas (5+) warrant hepatic ultrasound."
  - area: "Genitourinary"
    detail: "Males: confirm bilateral descended testes, assess for inguinal hernia or hydrocele. Females: assess for labial adhesions."
    teaching_point: "Undescended testes should be referred to urology if not descended by 6 months. Inguinal hernia presents as a groin bulge that increases with crying or straining -- surgical referral needed. Communicating hydroceles transilluminate and typically resolve by 12 months."

common_mistakes:
  - "Skipping the hip exam (Barlow/Ortolani) or performing it too gently to detect instability"
  - "Failing to screen the mother for postpartum depression at the 2-month visit"
  - "Not performing bilateral simultaneous red reflex testing"
  - "Omitting vitamin D counseling for exclusively breastfed infants"
  - "Forgetting to assess femoral pulses when a murmur is detected (missing coarctation)"
  - "Providing overly reassuring anticipatory guidance on sleep without asking about safe sleep practices"
  - "Not counseling on shaken baby prevention when parent reports excessive crying"
  - "Using CDC growth charts instead of WHO growth charts for infants under 24 months"
  - "Dismissing parental concern about developmental progress without formal milestone assessment"
  - "Missing the rotavirus vaccine age window -- first dose must be given before 15 weeks 0 days"
