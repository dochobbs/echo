# Pediatric Obesity - Teaching Framework
topic: "Pediatric Obesity"
aliases: ["obesity", "overweight", "weight management"]
category: endocrine
age_range_months: [24, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know BMI percentile definitions for overweight and obesity"
  - "Screen for comorbidities"
  - "Apply motivational interviewing"
  - "Recognize when medication or surgery may be indicated"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not plotting BMI at every visit"
  - "Not screening for comorbidities (especially NAFLD)"
  - "Blaming/shaming approach (ineffective and harmful)"
  - "Missing secondary causes"

red_flags:
  - "Acanthosis nigricans (insulin resistance)"
  - "SCFE symptoms (hip/knee/thigh pain)"
  - "Sleep apnea symptoms"
  - "Signs of secondary cause (short stature, developmental delay)"
  - "Severe obesity (BMI ≥120% of 95th percentile)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Definitions: Overweight (85th-94th), Obesity (≥95th), Severe obesity (≥120% of 95th or BMI ≥35)"
  - "Screen for comorbidities: Lipids, glucose/A1c, ALT (NAFLD) starting at age 10 or puberty"
  - "Acanthosis nigricans = insulin resistance marker"
  - "Motivational interviewing > prescriptive advice for behavior change"
  - "5-2-1-0 daily goals: 5 fruits/veg, 2 hours max screen time, 1 hour physical activity, 0 sugary drinks"

key_history_questions:
  - "Diet: Typical day of eating? Sugary drinks? Fast food frequency?"
  - "Activity: How much daily? Type?"
  - "Screen time: How many hours?"
  - "Sleep: How many hours? Snoring?"
  - "Family history: Obesity, diabetes, heart disease?"
  - "Medications that cause weight gain?"
  - "Psychosocial: Bullying, depression, anxiety?"
  - "Readiness to change?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "BMI percentile - plot on growth chart"
  - "Blood pressure (use appropriate cuff size)"
  - "Acanthosis nigricans (neck, axillae)"
  - "Striae"
  - "Hepatomegaly (NAFLD)"
  - "Tanner staging"
  - "Signs of secondary cause: Short stature, dysmorphisms"
  - "Limited hip ROM (SCFE risk)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Motivational interviewing - meet patient where they are"
  - "5-2-1-0 framework for lifestyle goals"
  - "Family-based approach - whole family changes"
  - "Intensive behavioral therapy for moderate-severe obesity"
  - "Pharmacotherapy: Consider if BMI ≥95th + comorbidity or ≥120% of 95th (age ≥12)"
  - "Bariatric surgery: Severe obesity with comorbidities, failed other treatments"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Labs: Lipids, fasting glucose or A1c, ALT (age ≥10 or puberty onset)"
  - "Refer: Dietitian/nutrition, behavioral health if available"
  - "Subspecialty obesity clinic: Severe obesity, comorbidities, considering medication"
  - "Endocrine: If secondary cause suspected"
  - "Follow-up: Every 3-6 months for weight management"
