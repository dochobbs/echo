# Functional Constipation - Teaching Framework
topic: "Functional Constipation"
aliases: ["constipation", "encopresis", "stool withholding"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize functional constipation as behavioral (not organic)"
  - "Know PEG 3350 is first-line maintenance therapy"
  - "Understand disimpaction before maintenance"
  - "Address overflow incontinence (encopresis)"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering imaging or labs for typical presentation"
  - "Starting maintenance without adequate disimpaction first"
  - "Stopping treatment too early (need months to years)"
  - "Blaming child for encopresis (it's involuntary)"

red_flags:
  - "Constipation since birth (Hirschsprung disease)"
  - "Delayed passage of meconium >48 hours"
  - "Empty rectal vault on exam (Hirschsprung)"
  - "Failure to thrive"
  - "Bilious vomiting"
  - "Abnormal neurologic exam, sacral anomalies"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Functional constipation: Stool is PALPABLE rectally (vs empty in Hirschsprung)"
  - "Disimpact FIRST: PEG high dose (1-1.5 g/kg/day) x 3-6 days or enema"
  - "Then maintenance: PEG 0.4-0.8 g/kg/day for MONTHS - don't stop too soon"
  - "Encopresis = overflow incontinence - child doesn't feel it, don't punish"
  - "Rome IV criteria for diagnosis - no labs/imaging needed for typical cases"

key_history_questions:
  - "Stool frequency? Consistency?"
  - "Painful to pass? Blood on stool?"
  - "Stool accidents (soiling)?"
  - "Withholding behaviors (posturing, hiding)?"
  - "When did meconium pass at birth?"
  - "Diet - fiber, fluids?"
  - "History of stool training? Any regression?"
  - "Abdominal pain?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Abdominal exam - stool palpable in LLQ"
  - "Perianal inspection (fissures, tags)"
  - "Rectal exam if indicated - stool in vault (NOT empty)"
  - "Neurologic exam (lower extremity, sacral)"
  - "Check for sacral dimple, tuft of hair"

treatment_principles:
  - "Step 1 - Disimpaction: PEG 1-1.5 g/kg/day x 3-6 days OR enema"
  - "Step 2 - Maintenance: PEG 0.4-0.8 g/kg/day, adjust to soft daily stool"
  - "Treat for MONTHS - minimum 2 months after symptoms resolve"
  - "Behavioral: Sit on toilet after meals (gastrocolic reflex), 5-10 minutes"
  - "Dietary: Fiber, fluids help but alone insufficient"
  - "Wean slowly when stable"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Typical functional constipation"
  - "GI referral: Red flags, failure to respond to treatment"
  - "Surgery: If Hirschsprung suspected (rectal biopsy for diagnosis)"
  - "Follow-up: 1 month, then every 2-3 months until resolved"

parent_styles: [frustrated-by-soiling, punitive, wants-quick-fix, anxious]
