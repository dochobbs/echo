# Acute Scrotum - Teaching Framework
topic: "Acute Scrotum"
aliases: ["testicular torsion", "acute scrotum", "scrotal pain"]
category: urology
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize testicular torsion as surgical emergency"
  - "Know 6-hour window for testicular salvage"
  - "Differentiate torsion from epididymitis and torsion of appendix testis"
  - "Never delay surgical consult for imaging"

common_mistakes:
  - "Waiting for ultrasound when torsion clinically suspected"
  - "Reassuring based on 'normal' exam (torsion can have minimal findings early)"
  - "Missing torsion in neonate"
  - "Treating all scrotal pain as epididymitis"

red_flags:
  - "Acute, severe onset"
  - "Absent cremasteric reflex"
  - "High-riding horizontal testis"
  - "Nausea/vomiting"
  - "Neonatal scrotal swelling/discoloration"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Testicular torsion: Surgical emergency - 6 hours for optimal salvage"
  - "TWIST score: Testis swelling, hard, elevated, absent reflex, nausea - high score = surgery"
  - "Cremasteric reflex: Absent in torsion, present in epididymitis (but not 100%)"
  - "Torsion of appendix testis: 'Blue dot sign', less acute, self-limited"
  - "Epididymitis: Gradual onset, may have fever/dysuria, positive Prehn's sign"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did pain start? What were you doing?"
  - "Onset sudden or gradual?"
  - "Any trauma?"
  - "Nausea or vomiting?"
  - "Previous similar episodes?"
  - "Dysuria, discharge, fever?"
  - "Sexual activity? (STI risk)"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Cremasteric reflex (stroke inner thigh → testis elevates)"
  - "Testis position (high-riding? Horizontal lie?)"
  - "Testis consistency (hard, swollen)"
  - "Epididymal tenderness (posterior - more suggests epididymitis)"
  - "Blue dot sign (pathognomonic for torsion of appendix testis)"
  - "Prehn's sign (elevation relieves pain → epididymitis; not reliable)"
  - "Scrotal skin (erythema, discoloration)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Torsion suspected: Immediate urology consult - DO NOT delay for imaging"
  - "Ultrasound: If diagnosis uncertain AND surgical availability rapid"
  - "Manual detorsion: Can attempt 'open book' detorsion while awaiting surgery"
  - "Surgery: Bilateral orchiopexy (contralateral fixation) if torsion confirmed"
  - "Torsion of appendix: Conservative - NSAIDs, rest, usually resolves in 1-2 weeks"
  - "Epididymitis: Antibiotics if infectious cause; STI treatment if adolescent"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Immediate urology consult: High suspicion for torsion"
  - "Ultrasound: Low-intermediate suspicion, rapid access"
  - "ED transfer: If torsion suspected and urology not immediately available"
  - "Observation/home: Torsion of appendix testis, epididymitis"
  - "Time is testis: 6 hours optimal, salvage drops significantly after 12 hours"

parent_styles: [panicked, delaying-because-embarrassed, not-aware-of-emergency]
