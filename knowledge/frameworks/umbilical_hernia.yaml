# Umbilical Hernia - Teaching Framework
topic: "Umbilical Hernia"
aliases: ["belly button hernia", "umbilical bulge"]
category: surgical
age_range_months: [0, 60]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize umbilical hernia and distinguish from other masses"
  - "Understand natural history and resolution rates"
  - "Know indications for surgical referral"
  - "Counsel families on watchful waiting"
  - "Identify signs of incarceration"

common_mistakes:
  - "Referring all umbilical hernias for surgery"
  - "Recommending taping or binding (doesn't work)"
  - "Not recognizing signs of incarceration"
  - "Missing other causes of umbilical mass"
  - "Unnecessary worry in small hernias"

red_flags:
  - "Irreducible hernia (possible incarceration)"
  - "Pain, tenderness at hernia site"
  - "Skin color change over hernia"
  - "Vomiting with distension"
  - "Hernia > 2 cm that isn't closing by age 4-5"
  - "Rapidly enlarging hernia"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Very common: 10-30% of newborns, higher in African Americans"
  - "Most close spontaneously by age 4-5 years"
  - "Defect < 1 cm: 90% close by age 4"
  - "Defect > 1.5 cm: less likely to close spontaneously"
  - "Incarceration rare in children (unlike adults)"
  - "Taping, coins, binders do NOT help and may cause skin breakdown"
  - "Proboscoid (long, protruding) hernias often referred earlier"
  - "Usually reducible - demonstrate this to reassure parents"

key_history_questions:
  - "When first noticed?"
  - "Getting bigger or same size?"
  - "Does it reduce when baby is calm/sleeping?"
  - "Any episodes where it wouldn't go back in?"
  - "Pain, vomiting, or behavior changes?"
  - "Does it bother the child?"
  - "Prematurity?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Soft, non-tender bulge at umbilicus"
  - "Increases with crying, straining, coughing"
  - "Easily reducible"
  - "Measure fascial defect size"
  - "No skin changes"
  - "If irreducible: concerning for incarceration"

treatment_principles:
  - "Watchful waiting for most hernias < age 4-5"
  - "No taping, binding, or home remedies"
  - "Surgery if: still present at age 4-5, defect > 1.5-2 cm, symptoms"
  - "Earlier surgery for: incarceration, symptomatic, proboscoid"
  - "Outpatient umbilical herniorrhaphy when needed"
  - "Reduce incarcerated hernia if possible, then urgent surgery"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases with observation"
  - "Pediatric surgery referral: Large defect (> 1.5-2 cm), age > 4-5, symptomatic"
  - "Urgent surgical evaluation: Incarcerated hernia, irreducible"
  - "Emergency: Signs of strangulation (skin changes, severe pain, vomiting)"
  - "Follow-up: Annual well-child visits to monitor size"

parent_styles: [worried-about-appearance, wanting-surgery, reassured-by-watchful-waiting]
