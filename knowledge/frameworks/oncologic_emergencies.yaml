# Oncologic Emergencies - Teaching Framework
topic: "Oncologic Emergencies"
aliases: ["tumor lysis syndrome", "SVC syndrome", "spinal cord compression", "oncologic emergency"]
category: hematology_oncology
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize presentations suggesting malignancy"
  - "Know life-threatening oncologic emergencies"
  - "Understand tumor lysis syndrome prevention and treatment"
  - "Know when to consult oncology urgently"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing subtle signs of malignancy (night pain, weight loss, cytopenias)"
  - "Delaying workup for nonspecific symptoms"
  - "Not recognizing tumor lysis risk"
  - "Not checking labs before starting chemotherapy"

red_flags:
  - "Bone pain waking child from sleep"
  - "Unexplained cytopenias"
  - "Mediastinal mass with respiratory distress"
  - "Abdominal mass"
  - "Abnormal bruising, petechiae"
  - "Weight loss, persistent fever"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Uric acid, K, phosphate ↑; calcium ↓ - can cause renal failure, arrhythmias"
  - "SVC syndrome: Facial/upper extremity swelling, cough, dyspnea - AVOID sedation (airway collapse)"
  - "Spinal cord compression: Back pain, weakness, sensory changes, bladder/bowel dysfunction"
  - "Febrile neutropenia: Fever + ANC <500 → cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics IMMEDIATELY"
  - "ALL: Peak 2-5 years; pancytopenia, bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy"

key_history_questions:
  - "Bone or back pain? Worse at night?"
  - "Fevers, night sweats, weight loss?"
  - "Fatigue, pallor, bruising, bleeding?"
  - "Any mass or swelling felt?"
  - "Changes in gait, weakness?"
  - "Urinary or bowel changes?"
  - "Headaches, vomiting, vision changes?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Pallor, petechiae, bruising"
  - "Lymphadenopathy (location, character)"
  - "Hepatosplenomegaly"
  - "Abdominal mass"
  - "Neurologic exam (strength, sensation, reflexes)"
  - "Testicular exam (mass)"
  - "Fundoscopy (papilledema)"

treatment_principles:
  - "TLS prevention: Aggressive hydration, allopurinol or rasburicase, avoid potassium/phosphate"
  - "Febrile neutropenia: Blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime) within 1 hour"
  - "SVC syndrome: Avoid sedation, steroids, possible radiation"
  - "Spinal cord compression: High-dose steroids, urgent MRI, neurosurgery/radiation consult"
  - "Hyperleukocytosis: Hydration, avoid transfusion unless critical, leukapheresis if severe"

disposition_guidance:
  - "ED: Any suspected malignancy, oncologic emergency"
  - "Oncology consult: All new diagnoses, emergencies"
  - "Labs: CBC with differential, CMP (including uric acid, LDH, phosphorus), coags"
  - "Imaging: CXR (mediastinal mass), appropriate imaging based on symptoms"
  - "Admit: All oncologic emergencies, new diagnosis, febrile neutropenia"
