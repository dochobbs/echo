# Umbilical Issues (Hernia & Granuloma) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Umbilical Conditions"
aliases: ["umbilical hernia", "umbilical granuloma", "belly button issues"]
category: newborn
age_range_months: [0, 60]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish umbilical granuloma from other lesions"
  - "Know natural history of umbilical hernia"
  - "Understand treatment options for granuloma"
  - "Recognize rare complications"

common_mistakes:
  - "Taping or strapping umbilical hernia (causes skin infection)"
  - "Referring small umbilical hernia too early"
  - "Missing patent urachus in persistent granuloma"
  - "Confusing granuloma with umbilical polyp"

red_flags:
  - "Incarcerated umbilical hernia (rare but emergency)"
  - "Umbilical discharge persisting despite treatment"
  - "Periumbilical erythema or cellulitis"
  - "Patent urachus (urine from umbilicus)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Granuloma: Pink, moist stalk - treat with silver nitrate or topical salt"
  - "If granuloma persists, consider patent urachus"
  - "90% of umbilical hernias close spontaneously by age 4-5"
  - "Incarceration is VERY RARE for umbilical hernias (unlike inguinal)"
  - "Do NOT tape/strap hernias - causes skin infection, no benefit"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did the umbilical cord fall off?"
  - "Any drainage from the umbilicus?"
  - "Has the bulge changed in size?"
  - "Any episodes of color change or pain with the bulge?"
  - "Any previous treatment attempts?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Granuloma: Pink, moist, pedunculated tissue"
  - "Hernia: Reducible fascial defect"
  - "Size of fascial defect"
  - "Signs of incarceration (non-reducible, tender, discolored)"
  - "Periumbilical skin condition"

treatment_principles:
  - "Granuloma: Silver nitrate application or topical salt"
  - "Hernia: Observation until age 4-5 in most cases"
  - "Surgery for hernia: >2cm defect, not closing by age 4-5"
  - "Never tape or strap hernias"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Typical granuloma, reducible hernia"
  - "Follow-up: Serial hernia measurement"
  - "Surgery referral: Large defect (>2cm), age >4-5, symptomatic"
  - "Urgent: Incarceration (very rare)"

parent_styles: [anxious-about-appearance, wants-treatment, patient]
