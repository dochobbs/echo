immunizations_due:
  - vaccine: "Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis)"
    cvx: 115
    dose_number: "1 dose"
    notes: "Routinely given at 11-12 years; booster from childhood DTaP series"
  - vaccine: "HPV 9-valent (Human Papillomavirus)"
    cvx: 165
    dose_number: "2-dose series"
    notes: "Ages 11-12 routinely; 2 doses if series started before age 15 (0, 6-12 months); 3 doses if started at 15+ or immunocompromised"
  - vaccine: "MenACWY (Meningococcal conjugate)"
    cvx: 114
    dose_number: "1st dose at 11-12yr, booster at 16yr"
    notes: "First dose at 11-12 years; booster dose at age 16 for continued protection through college entry"
  - vaccine: "Influenza (Inactivated or Recombinant)"
    cvx: 150
    dose_number: "Annual"
    notes: "Annual vaccination for all persons 6 months and older; IIV or RIV; LAIV (CVX 151) is an alternative for healthy non-pregnant adolescents"
  - vaccine: "MenB (Meningococcal B)"
    cvx: 162
    dose_number: "Shared clinical decision"
    notes: "Not routinely recommended; shared clinical decision-making for ages 16-18 (Bexsero CVX 163 = 2 doses, Trumenba CVX 162 = 2-3 doses); recommended if asplenia, complement deficiency, or outbreak"
  - vaccine: "COVID-19 (updated formulation)"
    cvx: 229
    dose_number: "Per current ACIP guidance"
    notes: "Updated formulation per current season; check ACIP recommendations for dosing based on prior vaccination history"

physical_exam_focus:
  - area: "Vital signs and growth parameters"
    detail: "Blood pressure (use correct cuff size), height, weight, BMI with percentile plotting"
    teaching_point: "BMI percentiles: <5th underweight, 85-94th overweight, >=95th obesity. Use adult BP thresholds (120/80) for ages 13+. BMI trajectory is more informative than single measurement."
  - area: "Tanner staging (Sexual Maturity Rating)"
    detail: "Breast/genital development and pubic hair staging (Tanner I-V)"
    teaching_point: "Know normal timing: girls breast bud 8-13yr (mean 10), menarche 2-3yr after thelarche; boys testicular enlargement 9-14yr (mean 11.5). Precocious if <8yr girls/<9yr boys. Delayed if no breast by 13 or no testicular enlargement by 14."
  - area: "Skin examination"
    detail: "Acne assessment (comedonal, inflammatory, nodulocystic), self-harm marks, tattoos/piercings"
    teaching_point: "Grade acne severity to guide treatment. Inspect forearms, thighs, and abdomen for non-suicidal self-injury. Approach findings non-judgmentally and explore with the adolescent privately."
  - area: "Spine examination"
    detail: "Adam forward bend test for scoliosis, assess shoulder/hip symmetry, scoliometer if available"
    teaching_point: "Screen girls 10-12, boys 13-14. Scoliometer >5-7 degrees warrants AP spine X-ray. Pain with scoliosis is NOT typical of idiopathic scoliosis - investigate further."
  - area: "Thyroid examination"
    detail: "Inspect and palpate for goiter, nodules, or asymmetry"
    teaching_point: "Thyroid disease is common in adolescents, especially females. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in this age group. Palpable nodules >1cm need ultrasound."
  - area: "Cardiovascular examination"
    detail: "Auscultation in supine and standing; assess for murmurs, clicks, irregular rhythm"
    teaching_point: "Ask about exercise-related syncope, chest pain, palpitations, and family history of sudden cardiac death. New murmurs in adolescence warrant investigation. Innocent murmurs decrease with standing."
  - area: "Musculoskeletal screening"
    detail: "Sports preparticipation exam elements; assess joints, gait, and strength"
    teaching_point: "Apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter, Sever disease) is common during growth spurts. Ask about sports injuries. Identify overuse injuries early, especially in single-sport athletes."
  - area: "Mental status assessment"
    detail: "Observe affect, eye contact, engagement; assess mood during confidential interview"
    teaching_point: "This is NOT a formal mental status exam - it is integrating behavioral observation with clinical interview. Teens with depression may present as irritable rather than sad. Establish rapport before sensitive topics."

common_mistakes:
  - "Skipping confidential time alone with the adolescent"
  - "Performing the entire visit with the parent present, preventing honest disclosure"
  - "Not explaining confidentiality and its limits (harm to self, harm to others, abuse) to both teen and parent"
  - "Forgetting to screen for depression (PHQ-A) and substance use (CRAFFT) at every annual visit from age 12"
  - "Counseling on abstinence only without providing comprehensive sexual health education"
  - "Missing HPV vaccine opportunity or accepting parental refusal without thorough education on cancer prevention"
  - "Not assessing Tanner stage or being uncomfortable with pubertal assessment"
  - "Ignoring sleep complaints as 'normal teen behavior' without assessing for depression or circadian disruption"
  - "Failing to perform a structured HEEADSSS assessment and instead asking only surface-level questions"
  - "Not asking about suicidality when depression screen is positive"
  - "Missing the 16-year MenACWY booster dose"
  - "Overlooking signs of eating disorders in male adolescents"

  - "mental-health-stigma (dismisses emotional concerns as normal teenage behavior)"
  - "culturally-conservative (uncomfortable with sexual health discussion)"
  - "substance-use-denial (minimizes or normalizes teen experimentation)"
  - "achievement-focused (prioritizes academics/sports over mental wellbeing)"
