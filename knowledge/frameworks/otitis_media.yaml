# Acute Otitis Media - Teaching Framework
topic: "Acute Otitis Media"
aliases: ["AOM", "ear infection"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [6, 36]
seasonality:
  peak_months: [11, 12, 1, 2, 3]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish AOM from otitis media with effusion (OME)"
  - "Apply AAP observation criteria (age, severity, laterality)"
  - "Choose appropriate first-line antibiotic and correct dosing"
  - "Counsel on pain management as primary concern"
  - "Recognize when to refer to ENT"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating OME with antibiotics"
  - "Using standard-dose amoxicillin instead of high-dose"
  - "Not addressing pain management"
  - "Missing bilateral vs unilateral distinction for observation"
  - "Forgetting to reassess if no improvement in 48-72 hours"

red_flags:
  - "Mastoiditis (postauricular swelling, protrusion of pinna)"
  - "Facial nerve palsy"
  - "Signs of intracranial extension"
  - "Toxic-appearing child"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Bulging TM is the key finding - redness alone is not diagnostic"
  - "High-dose amoxicillin: 80-90 mg/kg/day divided BID"
  - "Observation option: >2yo, unilateral, non-severe, reliable follow-up"
  - "Pain control (ibuprofen/acetaminophen) is often more important than antibiotics"
  - "Recent antibiotic use → consider amox-clav or ceftriaxone"

key_history_questions:
  - "Ear tugging or pain?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Recent URI symptoms?"
  - "Previous ear infections? How many?"
  - "Any antibiotics in past 30 days?"
  - "Daycare attendance?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "TM mobility (pneumatic otoscopy)"
  - "TM position (bulging vs retracted vs neutral)"
  - "TM color and translucency"
  - "Presence of effusion"
  - "Mastoid tenderness or swelling"

treatment_principles:
  - "First-line: High-dose amoxicillin"
  - "Penicillin allergy: Cefdinir or azithromycin"
  - "Treatment failure: Amoxicillin-clavulanate or ceftriaxone IM"
  - "Duration: 10 days if <2yo, 5-7 days if >2yo with mild disease"

parent_styles: [anxious, experienced, antibiotic-seeking, antibiotic-hesitant]
