# Otitis Externa - Teaching Framework
topic: "Otitis Externa"
aliases: ["swimmer's ear", "external otitis", "AOE"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [24, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish otitis externa from otitis media"
  - "Recognize typical presentation and risk factors"
  - "Know appropriate topical treatment"
  - "Identify when wick placement is needed"
  - "Recognize malignant otitis externa"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating with oral antibiotics (topical is first-line)"
  - "Missing canal occlusion requiring wick"
  - "Confusing with otitis media"
  - "Not counseling on water precautions"
  - "Missing fungal otitis externa"

red_flags:
  - "Diabetic or immunocompromised patient (malignant OE risk)"
  - "Granulation tissue in canal"
  - "Severe pain out of proportion"
  - "Cranial nerve involvement"
  - "Fever with toxic appearance"
  - "Failure to improve with appropriate treatment"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Tragal tenderness and pain with pinna manipulation = OE"
  - "TM should be normal (if visible)"
  - "Canal edema, erythema, debris"
  - "Common after swimming, Q-tip use, hearing aids"
  - "Pseudomonas and S. aureus most common pathogens"
  - "Topical fluoroquinolone preferred if TM perforation possible"
  - "Wick needed if canal too swollen for drops to penetrate"

key_history_questions:
  - "Ear pain - worse with chewing or touching ear?"
  - "Recent swimming or water exposure?"
  - "Use of cotton swabs or ear buds?"
  - "Hearing aid or ear plug use?"
  - "Discharge from ear?"
  - "Previous episodes?"
  - "Diabetes or immune problems?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Pain with tragal pressure"
  - "Pain with pinna manipulation"
  - "Canal erythema and edema"
  - "Debris in canal"
  - "TM appearance (if visible - should be normal)"
  - "Periauricular lymphadenopathy"
  - "Assess for cellulitis of pinna"

treatment_principles:
  - "Topical antibiotic drops first-line (not oral)"
  - "Options: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone"
  - "Acetic acid (VoSol) for mild cases or prevention"
  - "Wick placement if canal too edematous for drops"
  - "Keep ear dry during treatment"
  - "Pain control with NSAIDs/acetaminophen"
  - "Duration: 7-10 days"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All uncomplicated cases"
  - "Return: No improvement in 48-72 hours"
  - "ENT referral: Severe edema requiring debridement, recurrent cases"
  - "Urgent evaluation: Diabetic/immunocompromised with severe symptoms"
  - "Prevention: Ear plugs for swimmers, avoid Q-tips"
