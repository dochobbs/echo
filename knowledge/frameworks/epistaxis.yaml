# Epistaxis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Epistaxis"
aliases: ["nosebleed", "nasal bleeding"]
category: ENT
age_range_months: [24, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Teach proper first aid technique"
  - "Identify anterior vs posterior bleeding"
  - "Recognize when bleeding disorder workup is needed"
  - "Know preventive measures"
  - "Understand when referral is indicated"

common_mistakes:
  - "Tilting head back (aspiration risk)"
  - "Packing nose too early before trying pressure"
  - "Missing signs of bleeding disorder"
  - "Not examining for septal pathology"
  - "Over-investigating single episode"

red_flags:
  - "Bilateral spontaneous bleeding"
  - "Bleeding from other sites (gums, easy bruising)"
  - "Family history of bleeding disorders"
  - "Difficult to control bleeding (> 20 minutes)"
  - "Hemodynamic instability"
  - "Anticoagulant use"
  - "Posterior bleeding (blood down throat)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "90% anterior from Kiesselbach's plexus"
  - "Nose picking is #1 cause in children"
  - "Dry air and allergies predispose to bleeding"
  - "Proper technique: lean forward, pinch soft part of nose, 10-15 min"
  - "Consider bleeding disorder if: recurrent, bilateral, other bleeding"
  - "Topical oxymetazoline can help with vasoconstriction"
  - "Posterior bleeds are rare in children but serious"

key_history_questions:
  - "Which nostril? Both?"
  - "How long did it bleed?"
  - "What were they doing when it started?"
  - "How often does this happen?"
  - "Any nose picking or trauma?"
  - "Recent URI or allergies?"
  - "Bleeding from anywhere else?"
  - "Easy bruising?"
  - "Family history of bleeding problems?"
  - "Medications including NSAIDs?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Anterior rhinoscopy - identify bleeding source"
  - "Kiesselbach's plexus vessels"
  - "Septal deviation or perforation"
  - "Signs of allergic rhinitis"
  - "Foreign body"
  - "Skin exam for petechiae, bruising"
  - "Gum exam for bleeding"

treatment_principles:
  - "First aid: sit upright, lean forward, pinch soft nose 10-15 min"
  - "No peeking - continuous pressure"
  - "Topical oxymetazoline spray if available"
  - "Saline gel or petroleum jelly to prevent recurrence"
  - "Humidifier for dry environments"
  - "Treat underlying allergies"
  - "Silver nitrate cautery if visible vessel (ENT)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Single episode, easily controlled"
  - "Labs if concerning: CBC, PT/PTT, VWF panel"
  - "ENT referral: Recurrent, failed home measures, needs cautery"
  - "Hematology referral: Suspected bleeding disorder"
  - "Emergency: Uncontrolled bleeding, posterior source, hemodynamic instability"
