# Impetigo - Teaching Framework
topic: "Impetigo"
aliases: ["school sores", "bullous impetigo", "non-bullous impetigo"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [6, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish non-bullous from bullous impetigo"
  - "Know when topical vs oral antibiotics indicated"
  - "Understand transmission and school exclusion"
  - "Recognize complications"
  - "Choose appropriate antibiotic coverage"

common_mistakes:
  - "Using topical antibiotics for extensive disease"
  - "Missing MRSA in treatment failures"
  - "Inadequate wound hygiene instruction"
  - "Not covering for S. aureus"
  - "Excessive school exclusion"

red_flags:
  - "Periorbital involvement (risk of cellulitis)"
  - "Rapidly spreading despite treatment"
  - "Systemic symptoms (fever, lymphadenopathy)"
  - "Signs of deeper infection"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"
  - "Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (hematuria, edema)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Non-bullous (most common): honey-crusted lesions, S. aureus and/or GAS"
  - "Bullous: flaccid blisters that rupture, S. aureus toxin-mediated"
  - "Ecthyma: ulcerative form, deeper dermis involvement"
  - "Topical mupirocin or retapamulin for localized disease"
  - "Oral antibiotics for extensive, bullous, or treatment failure"
  - "Cover for S. aureus (including MRSA in high-prevalence areas)"
  - "Post-strep glomerulonephritis can follow GAS impetigo"
  - "Contagious until 24-48h after starting antibiotics"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did lesions start?"
  - "How are they spreading?"
  - "Any preceding insect bites, cuts, or eczema?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Sick contacts?"
  - "Previous skin infections? MRSA history?"
  - "Any treatments tried?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Non-bullous: erythematous papules → vesicles → honey-crusted erosions"
  - "Bullous: flaccid bullae with clear/cloudy fluid → thin brown crust"
  - "Distribution: face (around nose, mouth), extremities"
  - "Regional lymphadenopathy"
  - "Signs of secondary spread"
  - "Deeper tissue involvement (ecthyma)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Localized non-bullous: topical mupirocin TID x 5-7 days"
  - "Extensive, bullous, or treatment failure: oral antibiotics"
  - "First-line oral: cephalexin or dicloxacillin"
  - "MRSA coverage: TMP-SMX, clindamycin, or doxycycline (if > 8 years)"
  - "Wound hygiene: gentle washing, remove crusts"
  - "Cover lesions"
  - "Treat underlying eczema if present"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All typical cases"
  - "School exclusion: Until 24h after starting treatment and lesions can be covered"
  - "Return: Worsening despite 48h of treatment, new systemic symptoms"
  - "Monitor urine: Dark/cola-colored urine suggests PSGN (1-2 weeks after GAS)"
  - "Culture: Treatment failure, recurrent, suspected MRSA"

parent_styles: [worried-about-scarring, frustrated-by-spread, school-policy-focused]
