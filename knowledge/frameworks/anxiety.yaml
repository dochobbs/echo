  - "OCD with severe rituals"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Somatic symptoms are COMMON: Headaches, stomachaches, chest pain"
  - "CBT is FIRST-LINE for mild-moderate anxiety"
  - "SSRIs for moderate-severe or CBT non-responders"
  - "School refusal: Early intervention critical - don't accommodate avoidance"
  - "Separation anxiety: Normal until age 3-4, concerning if severe/impairing later"

key_history_questions:
  - "What are the worries about? How often?"
  - "Physical symptoms (headaches, stomachaches, chest pain)?"
  - "Avoidance behaviors? School attendance?"

treatment_principles:
  - "Mild: CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy)"
  - "Moderate-Severe: CBT + SSRI (fluoxetine or sertraline)"
  - "CAMS study: CBT + SSRI most effective for moderate-severe"
  - "DO NOT accommodate avoidance - gradual exposure is key"
  - "Parent training component important"
  - "Benzodiazepines: Avoid in children (not first-line)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
