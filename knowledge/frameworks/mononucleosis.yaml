# Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Infectious Mononucleosis"
aliases: ["mono", "EBV", "glandular fever", "kissing disease"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [48, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize amoxicillin rash is NOT penicillin allergy"
  - "Counsel on activity restriction for splenic rupture prevention"
  - "Know when steroids are indicated"
  - "Avoid unnecessary antibiotics"

common_mistakes:
  - "Labeling amoxicillin rash as penicillin allergy"
  - "Not counseling on sports restriction"
  - "Using spleen palpation to clear for sports"
  - "Prescribing steroids for uncomplicated mono"

red_flags:
  - "Airway compromise ('kissing tonsils')"
  - "Severe abdominal pain (splenic rupture)"
  - "Significant hepatosplenomegaly"
  - "Thrombocytopenia with bleeding"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Amoxicillin causes viral rash in 90% of mono patients - NOT a penicillin allergy"
  - "No contact sports for minimum 21-28 days"
  - "Splenic exam is UNRELIABLE - time is the best clearer"
  - "'Kissing tonsils' require steroids to prevent airway obstruction"
  - "Most cases self-limited - supportive care only"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of symptoms?"
  - "Sore throat, fatigue, fever?"
  - "Any difficulty swallowing or breathing?"
  - "Abdominal pain?"
  - "Any recent antibiotics? Rash?"
  - "Participation in sports?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Tonsillar size and exudates"
  - "Cervical lymphadenopathy (posterior chain classic)"
  - "Splenomegaly"
  - "Hepatomegaly"
  - "Rash (especially if received amoxicillin)"
  - "Petechiae on palate"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care: Rest, hydration, pain control"
  - "Steroids: ONLY for airway compromise"
  - "Activity restriction: No contact sports 21-28 days minimum"
  - "Avoid amoxicillin/ampicillin (causes rash)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Uncomplicated mononucleosis"
  - "Admit: Airway compromise, severe symptoms"
  - "Sports clearance: Time-based (3-4 weeks minimum), not exam-based"

parent_styles: [worried-about-spleen, impatient-athlete, wants-antibiotics]
