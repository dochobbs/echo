# Chronic Cough - Teaching Framework
topic: "Chronic Cough"
aliases: ["persistent cough", "prolonged cough"]
category: respiratory
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Define chronic cough (> 4 weeks)"
  - "Recognize common causes by age group"
  - "Know when chest X-ray and other workup needed"
  - "Understand cough pointers suggesting specific diagnoses"
  - "Avoid unnecessary cough suppressants"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating with cough suppressants without diagnosis"
  - "Missing asthma as cause"
  - "Not asking about cough quality and timing"
  - "Overlooking post-nasal drip"
  - "Missing foreign body aspiration"
  - "Not considering pertussis"

red_flags:
  - "Hemoptysis"
  - "Digital clubbing"
  - "Failure to thrive"
  - "Wet/productive cough daily for > 4 weeks"
  - "Recurrent pneumonia"
  - "Choking episode suggesting aspiration"
  - "Night sweats, weight loss"
  - "Neonatal onset"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Chronic cough: > 4 weeks duration"
  - "Wet cough: suggests bacterial bronchitis, bronchiectasis"
  - "Dry cough + wheeze: think asthma"
  - "Barky cough: croup, habit cough"
  - "Paroxysmal with whoop/post-tussive vomiting: pertussis"
  - "Worse at night: asthma, post-nasal drip"
  - "Post-viral cough can last 3-4 weeks (not chronic yet)"
  - "Habit cough: absent during sleep, honking quality"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of cough?"
  - "Dry or wet/productive?"
  - "Worse at certain times (night, exercise, eating)?"
  - "Associated wheeze or shortness of breath?"
  - "Any choking episode or aspiration risk?"
  - "Fever, weight loss, night sweats?"
  - "Environmental exposures (smoke, allergens)?"
  - "Response to previous treatments?"
  - "History of atopy (eczema, allergies)?"
  - "Immunization status (pertussis)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Respiratory rate and work of breathing"
  - "Auscultation: wheeze, crackles, asymmetry"
  - "Digital clubbing"
  - "Nasal exam: allergic rhinitis signs"
  - "Tonsil and adenoid size"
  - "Growth parameters"
  - "Eczema or other atopic signs"

treatment_principles:
  - "Treat underlying cause, not just the cough"
  - "Post-nasal drip: treat allergic rhinitis"
  - "Asthma: inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators"
  - "Bacterial bronchitis: 2-4 weeks amoxicillin-clavulanate"
  - "Pertussis: macrolide (azithromycin)"
  - "Avoid OTC cough suppressants (ineffective, potentially harmful)"
  - "Habit cough: speech therapy, suggestion therapy"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "CXR indicated: Wet cough > 4 weeks, red flags, no clear cause"
  - "Pulmonology referral: Failed empiric treatment, concerning features"
  - "Sweat test: Recurrent pneumonia, failure to thrive"
  - "Bronchoscopy: Suspected foreign body, localized findings"
  - "Follow-up: 2-4 weeks after treatment initiation"
