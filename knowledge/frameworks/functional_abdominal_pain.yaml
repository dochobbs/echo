age_range_months: [48, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize patterns of functional abdominal pain disorders"
  - "Apply Rome IV criteria for diagnosis"
  - "Distinguish from organic causes"
  - "Know when further workup is indicated"
  - "Counsel on biopsychosocial model and treatment"

common_mistakes:
  - "Excessive testing causing iatrogenic harm"
  - "Missing alarm symptoms suggesting organic disease"
  - "Dismissing pain as 'not real'"
  - "Not addressing psychosocial factors"
  - "Repeated imaging for same symptoms"
  - "Failing to involve mental health early"

red_flags:
  - "Weight loss or growth failure"

  - "Right upper or right lower quadrant localized pain"
  - "Family history of IBD, celiac, or peptic ulcer disease"
  - "Joint symptoms or rash"
  - "Dysphagia or odynophagia"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Rome IV: pain at least 4 days/month for 2+ months"
  - "Periumbilical pain without radiation is classic"
  - "Pain rarely wakes child from sleep (organic pain does)"
  - "Normal growth and development strongly reassuring"
  - "Stress and anxiety commonly trigger symptoms"
  - "School avoidance may be associated"
  - "Validate that pain is real while explaining mechanism"

key_history_questions:
  - "Location, character, duration, frequency of pain?"
  - "Relation to meals, bowel movements, stress?"
  - "Associated symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation?"
  - "Any blood in stool or weight loss?"
  - "Does pain wake from sleep?"
  - "Impact on school attendance and activities?"
  - "Any stressors: school, family, peers?"
  - "Dietary triggers identified?"
  - "Family history of GI disorders?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Growth parameters - height, weight, BMI percentiles"
  - "Abdominal exam - distension, masses, organomegaly"
  - "Periumbilical vs localized tenderness"
  - "Signs of chronic disease"
  - "Perianal exam if appropriate"
  - "General affect and interaction"

treatment_principles:
  - "Reassurance with validation (pain is real)"
  - "Explain biopsychosocial model"
  - "Return to normal activities including school"
  - "Dietary modifications: fiber, limit lactose if indicated"
  - "Stress management and coping strategies"
  - "Consider cognitive behavioral therapy"
  - "Medications: peppermint oil, low-dose amitriptyline for severe cases"
  - "Avoid reinforcing sick role"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Classic presentation without alarm symptoms"
  - "Limited workup: CBC, inflammatory markers, celiac screen, stool studies"
  - "GI referral: Alarm symptoms, failed empiric management, diagnostic uncertainty"
  - "Mental health referral: Significant anxiety, depression, school avoidance"
  - "Follow-up: 2-4 weeks to reassess"
