# Speech and Language Delay - Teaching Framework
topic: "Speech and Language Delay"
aliases: ["speech delay", "language delay", "late talker"]
category: developmental
age_range_months: [12, 60]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know language milestones"
  - "Distinguish speech (articulation) from language (comprehension/expression)"
  - "Always rule out hearing loss first"
  - "Refer early - don't wait and see"

common_mistakes:
  - "Reassuring 'boys talk late' without evaluation"
  - "Not ordering hearing test"
  - "Waiting for 'catch up' without intervention"
  - "Missing ASD in child with language delay"

red_flags:
  - "No babbling by 12 months"
  - "No single words by 16 months"
  - "No 2-word phrases by 24 months"
  - "Regression of language at any age"
  - "Not following simple commands by 18 months"

clinical_pearls:
  - "ALWAYS rule out hearing loss first - audiogram for any speech delay"
  - "Language milestones: 12mo 1-2 words, 18mo 10+ words, 24mo 50+ words + 2-word phrases"
  - "Receptive > Expressive typically; if receptive delayed, more concerning"
  - "Don't wait - refer to Early Intervention by 18-24 months if concerned"
  - "Bilingual children should have same number of words across languages combined"

key_history_questions:
  - "Current vocabulary? Any phrases?"
  - "Does child understand commands?"
  - "Any concerns about hearing?"
  - "Social engagement (eye contact, pointing, shared attention)?"
  - "Motor milestones?"
  - "Family history of speech delay, learning disabilities, ASD?"
  - "Languages spoken at home?"
  - "Screen time exposure?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Developmental screening (ASQ, PEDS)"
  - "ASD screening (M-CHAT at 18, 24 months)"
  - "Observe communication attempts"
  - "Response to name, joint attention"
  - "Ear exam (effusion?)"
  - "Oral motor exam"
  - "Overall developmental status"

treatment_principles:
  - "Audiogram: Required for any speech delay"
  - "Early Intervention: Refer immediately upon concern (before age 3)"
  - "Speech-language therapy"
  - "If social deficits: ASD evaluation"
  - "Parent coaching on language stimulation"
  - "Reduce screen time, increase interactive communication"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Audiology: For all speech delays"
  - "Early Intervention (0-3 years): Refer immediately"
  - "School district (3+ years): For continued services"
  - "Developmental pediatrics: If global delay or ASD concern"
  - "Follow-up: Closely until connected with services"

parent_styles: [in-denial, blaming-screens, comparing-to-siblings, anxious-early-referral]
