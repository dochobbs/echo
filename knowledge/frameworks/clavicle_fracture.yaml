# Clavicle Fracture - Teaching Framework
topic: "Clavicle Fracture"
aliases: ["broken collarbone", "clavicular fracture", "birth injury clavicle"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize presentation in different age groups"
  - "Know typical mechanism by age"
  - "Understand conservative management as standard"
  - "Identify rare surgical indications"
  - "Recognize neonatal clavicle fracture"

common_mistakes:
  - "Over-treating with rigid immobilization"
  - "Missing in neonate (pseudoparalysis)"
  - "Ordering excessive imaging"
  - "Not recognizing figure-8 brace is optional"
  - "Missing associated injuries in high-energy trauma"

red_flags:
  - "Tenting of skin (near open fracture)"
  - "Neurovascular compromise"
  - "Open fracture"
  - "Floating shoulder (scapula + clavicle fracture)"
  - "High-energy mechanism (associated injuries)"
  - "Distal fracture with significant displacement"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Most common fracture in children"
  - "Middle third most common location (80%)"
  - "Newborns: birth trauma, large for gestational age"
  - "Neonatal: pseudoparalysis, asymmetric Moro, palpable crepitus"
  - "Older children: FOOSH or direct blow"
  - "Heals well conservatively in children"
  - "Bump at fracture site (callus) is normal, resolves over months"
  - "Figure-8 brace vs sling - both acceptable, comfort is key"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism - fall, direct blow?"
  - "Arm movement since injury?"
  - "For newborn: delivery history, size?"
  - "Pain location?"
  - "Any numbness or tingling in arm/hand?"
  - "Previous injuries?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Point tenderness over clavicle"
  - "Swelling, deformity, crepitus"
  - "Arm held at side, resists movement"
  - "Tenting of skin?"
  - "Distal neurovascular exam (pulses, sensation, motor)"
  - "Neonate: asymmetric Moro, pseudoparalysis"
  - "Scapula exam (floating shoulder)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Conservative treatment for nearly all pediatric clavicle fractures"
  - "Sling for comfort (2-4 weeks)"
  - "Figure-8 brace: optional, no proven advantage over sling"
  - "Pain control: acetaminophen, NSAIDs"
  - "Ice for swelling"
  - "Neonates: gentle handling, usually heals in 7-10 days"
  - "Return to activity when pain-free, full ROM (usually 4-6 weeks)"
  - "Contact sports: 6-8 weeks or when healed"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All closed midshaft fractures"
  - "Orthopedics referral: Distal fractures, significantly displaced, skin tenting"
  - "Urgent ortho: Open fracture, neurovascular compromise"
  - "Neonatal: Reassurance, careful handling, no immobilization needed"
  - "Follow-up: 1-2 weeks for recheck, healing at 4-6 weeks"
  - "Counsel: Visible/palpable bump is normal, remodels over time"
