# Early-Onset Sepsis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Early-Onset Sepsis"
aliases: ["neonatal sepsis", "EOS", "newborn sepsis"]
category: newborn
age_range_months: [0, 1]

teaching_goals:
  - "Use the Kaiser Sepsis Calculator appropriately"
  - "Understand value of serial physical exams in equivocal cases"
  - "Know adequate GBS prophylaxis criteria"
  - "Balance antibiotic stewardship with safety"

common_mistakes:
  - "Automatically treating all infants with maternal chorioamnionitis"
  - "Not using Sepsis Calculator to guide decisions"
  - "Forgetting serial exams as alternative to labs in equivocal cases"
  - "Missing inadequate GBS prophylaxis (<4 hours before delivery)"

red_flags:
  - "Maternal chorioamnionitis"
  - "GBS positive without adequate prophylaxis"
  - "Prolonged rupture of membranes (>18 hours)"
  - "Preterm delivery"
  - "Clinical signs: temperature instability, tachypnea, poor feeding"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Sepsis Calculator significantly reduces unnecessary antibiotic use"
  - "Serial exams q4h are as sensitive as lab work for detecting deterioration"
  - "GBS prophylaxis is adequate if given >4 hours before delivery"
  - "Clinical Observation zone: serial exams preferred over automatic labs"

key_history_questions:
  - "Maternal GBS status?"
  - "Duration of rupture of membranes?"
  - "Maternal fever or signs of chorioamnionitis?"
  - "Intrapartum antibiotic timing and type?"
  - "Gestational age?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Temperature stability"
  - "Respiratory effort and rate"
  - "Feeding behavior"
  - "Tone and activity"
  - "Skin color and perfusion"

treatment_principles:
  - "Use Sepsis Calculator for risk stratification"
  - "Serial clinical observation for equivocal risk"
  - "Ampicillin + Gentamicin for empiric coverage"
  - "Blood culture before antibiotics when possible"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Enhanced observation: Low-risk per calculator"
  - "Admit for workup: High-risk or clinical signs"
  - "Serial exams q4h: Equivocal risk zone"

parent_styles: [anxious, trusting, questioning]
