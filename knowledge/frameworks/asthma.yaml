# Asthma Diagnosis & Management - Teaching Framework
topic: "Asthma"
aliases: ["reactive airway disease", "RAD", "wheezing"]
category: respiratory
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Classify asthma severity and control"
  - "Apply SMART therapy concept"
  - "Use Rule of Twos for assessment"
  - "Know spacers are as effective as nebulizers"

common_mistakes:
  - "Using albuterol alone for persistent asthma"
  - "Not prescribing ICS for persistent symptoms"
  - "Nebulizer preference over MDI with spacer"
  - "Not teaching proper inhaler technique"

red_flags:
  - "Severe exacerbation (can't speak in sentences)"
  - "History of ICU admission or intubation"
  - "Poor adherence to controller medication"
  - "Silent chest on auscultation"

clinical_pearls:
  - "SMART Therapy: ICS-Formoterol (Symbicort) as both controller AND reliever - superior to albuterol alone"
  - "Rule of Twos: Symptoms >2x/week or Night awakening >2x/month = Persistent asthma = Needs controller"
  - "MDIs with spacers are AS EFFECTIVE as nebulizers for acute flares"
  - "Inhaler technique is often the problem, not the medication"

key_history_questions:
  - "How often do you use albuterol (reliever)?"
  - "Night-time symptoms?"
  - "Activity limitations?"
  - "Missed school/daycare due to asthma?"
  - "Any ED visits or hospitalizations?"
  - "Current medications and adherence?"
  - "Known triggers?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Respiratory rate"
  - "Work of breathing"
  - "Wheezing (expiratory > inspiratory)"
  - "Air entry"
  - "Accessory muscle use"
  - "Oxygen saturation"
  - "Ability to speak in full sentences"

treatment_principles:
  - "Intermittent: SABA as needed only"
  - "Persistent: Daily ICS, consider ICS-LABA for moderate-severe"
  - "Acute: SABA + systemic steroids (prednisone 1-2 mg/kg)"
  - "Always use spacer with MDI"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Mild exacerbation, good response to treatment"
  - "Observe: Moderate exacerbation, assess response"
  - "Admit: Severe exacerbation, poor response, high-risk features"

parent_styles: [worried-about-steroids, non-adherent, well-controlled]
