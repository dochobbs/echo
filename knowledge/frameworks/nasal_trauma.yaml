# Nasal Trauma - Teaching Framework
topic: "Nasal Trauma"
aliases: ["broken nose", "nasal fracture", "nose injury"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [24, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize septal hematoma as emergency"
  - "Know when imaging is and isn't needed"
  - "Understand timing of reduction"
  - "Identify other facial injuries"
  - "Know appropriate referral timing"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing septal hematoma"
  - "Ordering X-rays for nasal fracture (clinical diagnosis)"
  - "Referring for immediate reduction (wait for swelling to decrease)"
  - "Missing associated injuries"
  - "Not reassessing after swelling resolves"

red_flags:
  - "Septal hematoma (dark purple bulge on septum - emergency)"
  - "CSF rhinorrhea (clear fluid, halo sign)"
  - "Periorbital ecchymosis (orbital fracture)"
  - "Infraorbital numbness (orbital floor fracture)"
  - "Malocclusion (mandible or maxilla fracture)"
  - "Telecanthus (NOE fracture)"
  - "Epistaxis not controlled"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Septal hematoma: dark purple bulging of septum - drain within 24-48h"
  - "X-rays not helpful - diagnosis is clinical"
  - "Swelling obscures deformity initially"
  - "Reassess for deformity after 3-5 days (swelling down)"
  - "Reduction ideally within 7-10 days (before healing)"
  - "Children heal faster - narrower window for reduction"
  - "Most pediatric nasal injuries are cartilaginous, not bony"
  - "Ice and elevation initially"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism of injury?"
  - "Nose bleeding - controlled now?"
  - "Previous nose shape?"
  - "Difficulty breathing through nose?"
  - "Any numbness of face or teeth?"
  - "Vision changes?"
  - "Head injury or loss of consciousness?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "External deformity (may be obscured by swelling)"
  - "Septal exam - LOOK FOR HEMATOMA (bilateral purple bulge)"
  - "Nasal airway patency"
  - "Crepitus or instability"
  - "Epistaxis - active or controlled?"
  - "CSF rhinorrhea (clear fluid, halo sign)"
  - "Periorbital exam (ecchymosis, EOM, vision)"
  - "Facial stability, dental occlusion"

treatment_principles:
  - "SEPTAL HEMATOMA: drain immediately (I&D, packing)"
  - "If untreated: septal abscess, saddle nose deformity"
  - "Epistaxis: direct pressure, can pack if needed"
  - "Ice and elevation for swelling"
  - "Pain control"
  - "No nose blowing"
  - "Sleep with head elevated"
  - "Reassess after swelling decreases (3-5 days)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Emergency: Septal hematoma (drain now), uncontrolled epistaxis"
  - "Urgent ENT (24-48h): Septal hematoma"
  - "ENT/plastics: Obvious deformity - refer for reduction in 5-10 days"
  - "Facial CT: If concern for other facial fractures, CSF leak"
  - "No X-ray needed for isolated nasal fracture"
  - "Return: Difficulty breathing, recurrent bleeding, worsening deformity"
