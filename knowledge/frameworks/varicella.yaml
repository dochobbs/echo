# Varicella (Chickenpox) & Zoster - Teaching Framework
topic: "Varicella & Herpes Zoster"
aliases: ["chickenpox", "shingles", "varicella-zoster"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know school exclusion criteria"
  - "Recognize complications requiring attention"
  - "Understand breakthrough varicella in vaccinated"
  - "Identify high-risk patients"

common_mistakes:
  - "Sending child back to school before all lesions crusted"
  - "Missing secondary bacterial superinfection"
  - "Underestimating severity in immunocompromised"
  - "Not recognizing breakthrough varicella"

red_flags:
  - "Bacterial superinfection (necrotizing fasciitis, Group A Strep)"
  - "Encephalitis symptoms"
  - "Pneumonia"
  - "Immunocompromised patient with varicella"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Exclusion: Keep home until ALL lesions are crusted over"
  - "Bacterial superinfection (especially Necrotizing Fasciitis/GAS) is major mortality risk"
  - "Breakthrough varicella in vaccinated: <50 lesions, no fever, still contagious"
  - "Acyclovir for immunocompromised, adolescents, adults, or complications"

key_history_questions:
  - "Vaccination status?"
  - "Known exposure?"
  - "Duration and progression of rash?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Any lesions looking infected (red, pus, increasing pain)?"
  - "Immunocompromised or on steroids?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Rash in different stages (macules, papules, vesicles, crusts)"
  - "Distribution (centripetal - more on trunk)"
  - "Signs of bacterial superinfection"
  - "Respiratory exam"
  - "Neurologic exam"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care for healthy children"
  - "Acyclovir: Immunocompromised, adolescents >13y, pregnant, complications"
  - "Bacterial superinfection: Aggressive antibiotics"
  - "Antihistamines and calamine for itch"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Uncomplicated varicella in healthy child"
  - "Admit: Immunocompromised, complications, severe disease"
  - "Return: Signs of bacterial infection, neurologic symptoms"

parent_styles: [worried-about-scarring, wants-antiviral, frustrated-about-exclusion]
