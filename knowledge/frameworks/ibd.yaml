# Inflammatory Bowel Disease - Teaching Framework
topic: "Inflammatory Bowel Disease"
aliases: ["IBD", "Crohn's disease", "ulcerative colitis", "UC"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [24, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize presenting features of IBD in children"
  - "Distinguish Crohn's from ulcerative colitis"
  - "Know fecal calprotectin as screening test"
  - "Understand growth failure is major concern"

common_mistakes:
  - "Attributing chronic abdominal pain to functional disease without labs"
  - "Missing growth failure as presenting sign"
  - "Not checking inflammatory markers"
  - "Delaying GI referral for chronic symptoms"

red_flags:
  - "Bloody diarrhea"
  - "Weight loss, poor growth"
  - "Perianal disease (fistulas, abscesses)"
  - "Fever with GI symptoms"
  - "Severe abdominal pain"
  - "Toxic megacolon"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Crohn's: Any part of GI tract, skip lesions, transmural, perianal disease common"
  - "UC: Rectum → colon only, continuous, mucosal, bloody diarrhea"
  - "Fecal calprotectin: Excellent screening - normal rules out active IBD"
  - "Growth failure may precede GI symptoms by months-years in Crohn's"
  - "10-25% of IBD presents before age 20"

key_history_questions:
  - "Diarrhea - bloody? Nocturnal? How long?"
  - "Abdominal pain - location, relation to meals/defecation?"
  - "Weight loss? Poor appetite?"
  - "Growth trajectory?"
  - "Mouth ulcers? Joint pains? Eye redness?"
  - "Skin rashes (erythema nodosum, pyoderma)?"
  - "Family history of IBD?"
  - "Perianal symptoms (pain, drainage)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Growth parameters - height, weight, BMI velocity"
  - "Abdominal tenderness, masses (Crohn's)"
  - "Perianal exam - tags, fissures, fistulas"
  - "Signs of malnutrition, pallor"
  - "Oral ulcers"
  - "Joint swelling"
  - "Eye exam (episcleritis, uveitis)"

treatment_principles:
  - "GI referral: All suspected IBD for endoscopy"
  - "Diagnosis requires colonoscopy + upper endoscopy + histology"
  - "Treatment depends on severity and location"
  - "Induction: Steroids, exclusive enteral nutrition (Crohn's)"
  - "Maintenance: Immunomodulators, biologics (anti-TNF)"
  - "Monitor growth closely - optimize nutrition"

disposition_guidance:
  - "GI referral: Urgent for any suspected IBD"
  - "ED: Severe symptoms, dehydration, high fever, toxic appearance"
  - "Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, fecal calprotectin, stool studies"
  - "Multidisciplinary: GI, nutrition, psychology, surgery (if complications)"
