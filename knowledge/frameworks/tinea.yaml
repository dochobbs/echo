# Tinea Infections - Teaching Framework
topic: "Tinea Infections"
aliases: ["ringworm", "tinea capitis", "tinea corporis", "tinea pedis", "athlete's foot"]
category: derm
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize tinea capitis requires ORAL therapy"
  - "Distinguish tinea from other annular lesions"
  - "Know griseofulvin dosing and duration"
  - "Understand kerion management"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating tinea capitis with topical antifungals alone (won't work)"
  - "Missing tinea capitis because of atypical presentation"
  - "Confusing nummular eczema with tinea corporis"
  - "Not treating long enough"

red_flags:
  - "Kerion (inflammatory mass) - needs oral antifungal + may need steroids"
  - "Id reaction (widespread papular eruption)"
  - "Immunocompromised patient with extensive disease"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Tinea CAPITIS = ORAL therapy - topicals don't penetrate hair follicle"
  - "Griseofulvin: Give with fatty food for absorption, treat 6-8 weeks"
  - "KOH prep or fungal culture to confirm diagnosis"
  - "Kerion: Oral antifungal + short course steroids (prevents scarring alopecia)"

key_history_questions:
  - "Where is the rash? How long?"
  - "Any pets with skin problems?"
  - "Anyone else in household affected?"
  - "Any scalp scaling, hair loss, or tender bumps?"
  - "What treatments have been tried?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Annular, scaly plaques with central clearing (corporis)"
  - "Scalp: scaling, broken hairs, 'black dot' pattern"
  - "Kerion: boggy, tender mass with pustules"
  - "Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy (capitis)"
  - "Fluorescence under Wood's lamp (some species)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Tinea corporis: Topical antifungal (clotrimazole, terbinafine) x 2-4 weeks"
  - "Tinea capitis: Griseofulvin 20-25 mg/kg/day x 6-8 weeks"
  - "Alternative: Terbinafine (shorter course, but griseofulvin preferred in kids)"
  - "Kerion: Add prednisone 1 mg/kg x 1-2 weeks"
  - "Selenium sulfide shampoo to reduce spore shedding"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Dermatology referral: Kerion, refractory cases"
  - "Follow-up: 4-6 weeks to assess response"
  - "Return to school: After starting treatment"
