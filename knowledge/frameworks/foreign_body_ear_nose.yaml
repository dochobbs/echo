# Foreign Body (Ear/Nose) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Foreign Body - Ear and Nose"
aliases: ["FB ear", "FB nose", "nasal foreign body", "aural foreign body"]
category: ENT
age_range_months: [12, 72]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize signs of foreign body in ear or nose"
  - "Know removal techniques and when to refer"
  - "Understand button battery emergency"
  - "Identify high-risk foreign bodies"
  - "Know when not to attempt removal"

common_mistakes:
  - "Multiple failed removal attempts causing trauma"
  - "Missing button battery (emergency)"
  - "Not identifying type of foreign body before removal"
  - "Using wrong technique for FB type"
  - "Missing second foreign body"
  - "Irrigating ear with organic material (swells)"

red_flags:
  - "Button battery (nasal emergency - tissue necrosis in 2-4 hours)"
  - "Magnet (especially multiple magnets)"
  - "Unilateral foul-smelling nasal discharge (chronic FB)"
  - "Signs of infection or abscess"
  - "Penetrating foreign body"
  - "Live insect in ear (remove before other attempts)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Button battery in nose: < 2 hour window to prevent septal perforation"
  - "Nasal FB: unilateral purulent, foul-smelling discharge classic"
  - "Ear FB: may be asymptomatic or present with pain, discharge, hearing loss"
  - "Smooth round objects: positive pressure (parent kiss) or suction"
  - "Insects: kill first with mineral oil or lidocaine, then remove"
  - "Never irrigate organic material (beans, peas - they swell)"
  - "One or two attempts max before ENT referral"

key_history_questions:
  - "Did anyone witness insertion?"
  - "What type of object?"
  - "How long ago?"
  - "Any nasal discharge, odor, ear pain, drainage?"
  - "Previous attempts at removal?"
  - "Could there be more than one?"
  - "Is it a button battery? (emergency)"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Visualize foreign body with otoscope/nasal speculum"
  - "Assess for infection, granulation tissue"
  - "Identify FB type and characteristics"
  - "Check both sides (may be bilateral)"
  - "Signs of trauma from previous removal attempts"
  - "TM integrity if ear FB"

treatment_principles:
  - "Button battery: immediate removal - do not delay"
  - "Identify FB type before choosing technique"
  - "Nasal positive pressure (parent kiss) for round objects"
  - "Ear irrigation (water) for non-organic, non-battery objects"
  - "Alligator forceps for graspable objects"
  - "Suction catheter for smooth objects"
  - "Insects: instill mineral oil first to kill, then remove"
  - "Limit to 1-2 attempts to avoid trauma"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Emergency: Button battery - immediate removal or transfer"
  - "ENT referral: Failed attempts, deep FB, uncooperative child, TM involvement"
  - "Outpatient: Simple removal successful, no complications"
  - "Follow-up: After removal for ear to check TM; nose to confirm no residual"
