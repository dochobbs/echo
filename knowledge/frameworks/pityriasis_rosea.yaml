topic: "Pityriasis Rosea"
aliases: ["christmas tree rash", "herald patch"]
category: derm
age_range_months: [60, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize herald patch and Christmas tree pattern"
  - "Know this is self-limited - no treatment needed"
  - "Differentiate from secondary syphilis"
  - "Counsel on expected duration"

common_mistakes:
  - "Over-treating a self-limited condition"
  - "Missing secondary syphilis in sexually active adolescent"
  - "Diagnosing without recognizing herald patch history"
  - "Alarming family about extensive rash"

red_flags:
  - "Sexually active adolescent (rule out secondary syphilis)"
  - "Palm/sole involvement (syphilis, not PR)"
  - "Oral or genital lesions"
  - "Systemic symptoms (fever, lymphadenopathy)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Herald patch: Large single lesion appears 1-2 weeks BEFORE generalized eruption"
  - "Christmas tree pattern: Oval lesions follow skin cleavage lines on back"
  - "Self-limited: Resolves in 6-8 weeks without treatment"
  - "Secondary syphilis: Consider RPR in sexually active teens with similar rash"

key_history_questions:
  - "Did a single large spot appear first?"
  - "How long ago? Has rash spread since?"
  - "Any itching?"
  - "Any recent illness (viral prodrome)?"
  - "Sexual activity? (if adolescent)"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Herald patch: 2-10 cm oval, salmon-colored with collarette scale"
  - "Generalized eruption: Smaller oval patches in Christmas tree distribution"
  - "Spares face, palms, soles (unlike syphilis)"
  - "Collarette scale (trailing edge)"
  - "May have mild lymphadenopathy"

treatment_principles:
  - "No treatment needed - self-limited"
  - "Symptomatic: Antihistamines for pruritus"
  - "Topical steroids if very itchy"
  - "Sun exposure or UVB may accelerate resolution"
  - "Reassurance is the main intervention"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "No follow-up needed unless symptoms worsen"
  - "Counsel: Expect 6-8 weeks for resolution"
  - "RPR: If sexually active adolescent"

parent_styles: [worried-about-appearance, wants-reassurance]
