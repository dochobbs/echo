# Sprains and Strains - Teaching Framework
topic: "Sprains and Strains"
aliases: ["ankle sprain", "twisted ankle", "pulled muscle", "ligament injury"]
category: musculoskeletal
age_range_months: [60, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish sprain (ligament) from strain (muscle/tendon)"
  - "Apply Ottawa Ankle and Knee Rules"
  - "Grade sprains appropriately"
  - "Know RICE/PRICE protocol"
  - "Recognize injuries requiring imaging or referral"

common_mistakes:
  - "X-raying every ankle injury (Ottawa rules)"
  - "Missing Salter-Harris fracture in skeletally immature"
  - "Not assessing joint stability"
  - "Insufficient immobilization for grade 2-3 sprains"
  - "Not recommending physical therapy for moderate sprains"

red_flags:
  - "Unable to bear weight (4 steps)"
  - "Point tenderness over bone (malleolus, base 5th MT)"
  - "Gross instability"
  - "Neurovascular compromise"
  - "Open injury"
  - "Growth plate tenderness in children"
  - "Syndesmosis tenderness (high ankle sprain)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "In children, growth plate often weaker than ligament - consider Salter-Harris"
  - "Ottawa Ankle: X-ray if bony tenderness or can't bear weight"
  - "Ottawa Knee: X-ray if can't flex 90°, patella tenderness, fibular head"
  - "Grade 1: stretching, minimal swelling, stable"
  - "Grade 2: partial tear, moderate swelling, some laxity"
  - "Grade 3: complete tear, severe swelling, unstable"
  - "RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation"
  - "Ankle sprains: lateral (inversion) most common - ATFL"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism of injury?"
  - "Hear or feel a pop?"
  - "Able to bear weight after injury?"
  - "Swelling - immediate or delayed?"
  - "Previous injuries to same joint?"
  - "Sport or activity when injured?"
  - "Current pain level?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Swelling and ecchymosis location"
  - "Point tenderness (bone vs ligament)"
  - "Range of motion"
  - "Stability testing (anterior drawer, talar tilt for ankle)"
  - "Weight-bearing ability"
  - "Neurovascular status"
  - "Comparison to uninjured side"

treatment_principles:
  - "RICE: Rest, Ice (20 min q2-3h), Compression, Elevation"
  - "NSAIDs for pain and inflammation"
  - "Grade 1: weight-bear as tolerated, ankle brace"
  - "Grade 2: air stirrup or walking boot, crutches, PT"
  - "Grade 3: immobilization, orthopedic referral"
  - "Early mobilization better than prolonged immobilization"
  - "Physical therapy for moderate-severe sprains"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All grade 1 and most grade 2"
  - "X-ray: Ottawa rules positive, growth plate tenderness"
  - "Orthopedic referral: Grade 3, syndesmosis injury, suspected fracture"
  - "Sports medicine/PT: Recurrent sprains, athlete returning to sport"
  - "Return to sport: Full ROM, strength, and proprioception restored"
