# Adrenal Insufficiency - Teaching Framework
topic: "Adrenal Insufficiency"
aliases: ["adrenal crisis", "adrenal insufficiency", "CAH", "Addison disease"]
category: endocrine
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize adrenal crisis as life-threatening emergency"
  - "Know stress dosing for known adrenal insufficiency"
  - "Understand CAH is most common cause in pediatrics"
  - "Counsel families on emergency management"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not stress dosing during illness"
  - "Not recognizing subtle signs of adrenal crisis"
  - "Missing CAH in ambiguous genitalia (salt-wasting)"
  - "Delaying treatment while waiting for labs"

red_flags:
  - "Hypotension, shock (adrenal crisis)"
  - "Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia"
  - "Hypoglycemia"
  - "Ambiguous genitalia in newborn (CAH)"
  - "Hyperpigmentation (primary adrenal insufficiency)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Adrenal crisis: TREAT FIRST with stress dose steroids if suspected - don't wait for labs"
  - "CAH (21-hydroxylase deficiency): Most common cause in children; on newborn screen"
  - "Salt-wasting CAH presents at 1-2 weeks: Vomiting, dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia"
  - "Stress dosing: 3x usual dose for illness, IM hydrocortisone for vomiting/unable to take PO"
  - "All patients with AI need emergency injection kit and medic alert"

key_history_questions:
  - "Known adrenal insufficiency? On steroids?"
  - "Current illness? Fever, vomiting, diarrhea?"
  - "What steroids taken today? Missed doses?"
  - "Recent surgery or trauma?"
  - "Chronic steroid use for any reason? (Iatrogenic AI)"
  - "Fatigue, weight loss, salt craving?"
  - "Skin darkening?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Vital signs: Hypotension, tachycardia"
  - "Hydration status"
  - "Mental status"
  - "Hyperpigmentation (creases, scars, gingiva - primary AI)"
  - "Ambiguous genitalia in newborn (CAH)"
  - "Signs of virilization"

treatment_principles:
  - "Adrenal crisis: IV hydrocortisone 50-100 mg/m2 immediately + IV fluids"
  - "Stress dosing illness: Oral hydrocortisone 3x usual dose"
  - "Vomiting: IM hydrocortisone (50 mg for children, 25 mg for infants)"
  - "CAH: Hydrocortisone + fludrocortisone maintenance"
  - "Surgery: Stress dose steroids perioperatively"
  - "Never stop steroids abruptly"

disposition_guidance:
  - "ED: Any suspected adrenal crisis"
  - "Admit: Adrenal crisis, significant illness requiring IV steroids"
  - "Labs: Glucose, sodium, potassium, cortisol (before treatment if possible)"
  - "Endocrinology: All new diagnoses"
  - "Education: Emergency injection, medic alert, stress dosing"
