# Tics and Tourette Syndrome - Teaching Framework
topic: "Tics and Tourette Syndrome"
aliases: ["tic disorder", "Tourette", "motor tics", "vocal tics"]
category: behavioral
age_range_months: [36, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know most tics are transient and benign"
  - "Recognize Tourette syndrome diagnostic criteria"
  - "Understand tics often don't need treatment"
  - "Screen for ADHD and OCD comorbidities"

common_mistakes:
  - "Over-treating benign transient tics"
  - "Telling child to 'stop doing that'"
  - "Missing comorbid ADHD (more impairing than tics)"
  - "Attributing tics to stimulant medications incorrectly"

red_flags:
  - "Acute onset tics (consider PANDAS, drug-induced)"
  - "Associated neurologic signs"
  - "Severe self-injurious tics"
  - "Sudden onset OCD with tics (PANDAS)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Transient tic disorder: <1 year duration - most common, resolves"
  - "Tourette: Motor + vocal tics for >1 year, onset before 18"
  - "Tics wax and wane naturally - don't overreact to fluctuations"
  - "Comorbidities often MORE impairing: ADHD (50%), OCD (30%)"
  - "Stimulants can be used in ADHD + tics - may even improve tics"

key_history_questions:
  - "What movements or sounds? How long?"
  - "Worsening with stress, fatigue?"
  - "Premonitory urge?"
  - "Impact on school, social life?"
  - "Any OCD symptoms (intrusive thoughts, rituals)?"
  - "ADHD symptoms?"
  - "Recent strep infection? (PANDAS)"
  - "Family history of tics?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Observe for tics during visit"
  - "Type: Simple vs complex, motor vs vocal"
  - "Neurologic exam (should be normal)"
  - "Signs of strep pharyngitis"
  - "Look for OCD behaviors"
  - "ADHD screening"

treatment_principles:
  - "Most transient tics: Watchful waiting, education, reassurance"
  - "Don't call attention to tics - ignore if possible"
  - "Treat comorbidities first (ADHD, OCD often more impairing)"
  - "If tics impairing: CBIT (Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics)"
  - "Medications: Clonidine, guanfacine (also help ADHD)"
  - "Severe: Risperidone, aripiprazole (specialist use)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "Neurology: Complex, severe, sudden onset, atypical features"
  - "Psychiatry: Significant OCD, ADHD, or mood comorbidity"
  - "No treatment needed for mild, non-impairing tics"

parent_styles: [worried-about-stigma, wants-medication, reassurance-seeking]
