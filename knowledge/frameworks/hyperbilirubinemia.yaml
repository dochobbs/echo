# Hyperbilirubinemia (Jaundice) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia"
aliases: ["jaundice", "newborn jaundice", "neonatal jaundice"]
category: newborn
age_range_months: [0, 1]

teaching_goals:
  - "Use 2022 AAP nomograms (BiliTool) for treatment thresholds"
  - "Identify neurotoxicity risk factors that lower treatment threshold"
  - "Recognize elevated direct bilirubin as never physiologic"
  - "Know when rebound checks are needed vs unnecessary"

common_mistakes:
  - "Using outdated phototherapy thresholds (2022 guidelines are higher)"
  - "Missing elevated direct bilirubin (>1.0 mg/dL or >20% of total)"
  - "Ordering routine rebound checks when not indicated"
  - "Failing to refer direct hyperbilirubinemia for biliary atresia workup"

red_flags:
  - "Elevated direct bilirubin (>1.0 mg/dL or >20% of total)"
  - "Neurotoxicity risk factors (sepsis, acidosis, albumin <3.0)"
  - "Isoimmune hemolytic disease"
  - "Rapidly rising bilirubin"

clinical_pearls:
  - "2022 AAP thresholds are HIGHER than previous - reduces overtreatment"
  - "Direct bili elevation is NEVER physiologic - rule out biliary atresia immediately"
  - "Rebound checks only needed if hemolytic disease or treated <72h of life"
  - "Neurotoxicity risk factors: sepsis, acidosis, albumin <3.0, isoimmune hemolysis"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did jaundice first appear?"
  - "Feeding pattern - breast or formula? How often?"
  - "Stool color - yellow/green or pale/acholic?"
  - "Blood type incompatibility (mom vs baby)?"
  - "Family history of hemolytic disease (G6PD, spherocytosis)?"
  - "Any signs of infection or lethargy?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Cephalocaudal progression of jaundice"
  - "Hepatosplenomegaly"
  - "Lethargy or poor feeding"
  - "Stool color (acholic = biliary atresia)"
  - "Signs of sepsis"

treatment_principles:
  - "Use BiliTool app for precise thresholds"
  - "Phototherapy thresholds based on age in hours and risk factors"
  - "Exchange transfusion for severe cases approaching neurotoxicity"
  - "Optimize feeding to enhance bilirubin excretion"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Physiologic jaundice below phototherapy threshold"
  - "Admit: Requires phototherapy, direct hyperbilirubinemia workup"
  - "Urgent GI referral: Elevated direct bilirubin (biliary atresia)"

parent_styles: [anxious, first-time, experienced]
