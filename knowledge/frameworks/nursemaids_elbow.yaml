# Nursemaid's Elbow - Teaching Framework
topic: "Nursemaid's Elbow"
aliases: ["nursemaid's elbow", "radial head subluxation", "pulled elbow"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [6, 60]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic presentation and mechanism"
  - "Perform reduction maneuver confidently"
  - "Know imaging is not needed for typical presentation"
  - "Counsel on prevention"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering X-rays before attempting reduction"
  - "Missing atypical mechanism (fall on outstretched hand)"
  - "Not educating parents on prevention"
  - "Misdiagnosing as clavicle or supracondylar fracture"

red_flags:
  - "Significant swelling or deformity (fracture)"
  - "Point tenderness over bone"
  - "Mechanism involving fall (consider supracondylar fracture)"
  - "Child over 5 years (subluxation less common)"
  - "Failure of reduction to restore function"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic mechanism: Longitudinal traction on extended, pronated arm (pulling toddler by hand)"
  - "Child holds arm pronated, close to body, refuses to use"
  - "No X-ray needed for classic presentation - go straight to reduction"
  - "Reduction: Supination + flexion or hyperpronation - feel 'click'"
  - "Child uses arm within 10-15 minutes after successful reduction"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism - was arm pulled or yanked?"
  - "Or did child fall? On outstretched hand?"
  - "When did this happen?"
  - "Has this happened before?"
  - "Has child used the arm at all since?"
  - "Any swelling or bruising?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Arm held pronated, slightly flexed, close to body"
  - "Refuses to use arm, cries when moved"
  - "NO swelling (if swelling present, consider fracture)"
  - "No point tenderness over clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna"
  - "Elbow appears normal"
  - "Wrist and hand move normally when not moving elbow"

treatment_principles:
  - "Reduction technique: Hyperpronation (higher success) OR supination-flexion"
  - "Hyperpronation: Support elbow, fully pronate forearm with pressure on radial head"
  - "Supination-flexion: Supinate forearm while flexing elbow, finger on radial head for 'click'"
  - "Successful reduction: Child uses arm within 10-15 minutes"
  - "If unsuccessful: X-ray to rule out fracture, try again"
  - "Sling: Only if repeated reduction attempts needed"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Home: After successful reduction and observed use of arm"
  - "No X-ray needed for typical presentation"
  - "X-ray if: Mechanism atypical, swelling, failed reduction, no improvement"
  - "Counsel: Don't pull on extended arm, recurrence common"

parent_styles: [guilty, anxious, scared-about-fracture]
