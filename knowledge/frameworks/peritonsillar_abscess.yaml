# Peritonsillar Abscess - Teaching Framework
topic: "Peritonsillar Abscess"
aliases: ["PTA", "quinsy", "tonsillar abscess"]
category: ENT
age_range_months: [60, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize clinical presentation"
  - "Distinguish from severe pharyngitis and other deep neck infections"
  - "Know when imaging is needed"
  - "Understand drainage options"
  - "Identify airway compromise"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing abscess in child with 'bad sore throat'"
  - "Not examining for trismus and uvula deviation"
  - "Delaying drainage"
  - "Missing retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal extension"
  - "Not considering in mononucleosis patients"

red_flags:
  - "Airway compromise (stridor, drooling, tripod positioning)"
  - "Bilateral abscess (rare)"
  - "Rapid progression"
  - "Extension to parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal space"
  - "Sepsis"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Trismus (difficulty opening mouth) is key finding"
  - "Uvula deviation away from affected side"
  - "'Hot potato' or muffled voice"
  - "Unilateral tonsillar bulge and erythema"
  - "Often follows strep pharyngitis or mononucleosis"
  - "Fusobacterium and Group A strep common pathogens"
  - "Needle aspiration or I&D is treatment"
  - "Can often be done in ED without OR in cooperative patient"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration and progression of sore throat?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Difficulty opening mouth?"
  - "Difficulty swallowing, drooling?"
  - "Voice changes - muffled?"
  - "Neck stiffness or swelling?"
  - "Previous sore throats or tonsillitis?"
  - "Recent treatment for pharyngitis?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Trismus - inability to open mouth fully"
  - "Uvula deviation"
  - "Unilateral tonsillar bulge"
  - "Peritonsillar erythema and swelling"
  - "Cervical lymphadenopathy"
  - "'Hot potato' voice"
  - "Drooling"
  - "Torticollis (neck tilted to affected side)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Drainage: needle aspiration or I&D"
  - "IV antibiotics: ampicillin-sulbactam or clindamycin"
  - "Steroids: dexamethasone reduces inflammation"
  - "Pain control and hydration"
  - "Most can be done in ED with cooperative patient"
  - "OR drainage if uncooperative, complex, or airway concern"
  - "Tonsillectomy not usually needed acutely (consider if recurrent)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admission: Most patients after drainage for IV antibiotics"
  - "Observation: Mild cases, adequate PO, reliable follow-up"
  - "ENT consultation: All cases"
  - "CT neck: If concern for deeper space infection"
  - "Airway management: Anesthesia involvement if airway concern"
  - "Follow-up: ENT to discuss tonsillectomy if recurrent"

parent_styles: [anxious, concerned-about-airway, antibiotic-questioning]
