# Henoch-Schönlein Purpura - Teaching Framework
topic: "Henoch-Schönlein Purpura"
aliases: ["HSP", "IgA vasculitis", "anaphylactoid purpura"]
category: msk
age_range_months: [24, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic tetrad of symptoms"
  - "Know renal involvement determines long-term prognosis"
  - "Understand management is primarily supportive"
  - "Monitor for complications"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing diagnosis in child with abdominal pain before rash appears"
  - "Not checking urine for hematuria/proteinuria"
  - "Not following long-term for renal involvement"
  - "Over-treating with steroids (controversial benefit)"

red_flags:
  - "Severe abdominal pain (intussusception, GI bleeding)"
  - "Altered mental status (CNS involvement, rare)"
  - "Scrotal swelling/pain (orchitis)"
  - "Significant renal involvement (nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypertension)"
  - "Bloody stools"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic tetrad: Palpable purpura + arthritis/arthralgia + abdominal pain + renal involvement"
  - "Rash: Palpable purpura on lower extremities and buttocks - DOES NOT blanch"
  - "GI: Abdominal pain may precede rash by up to 2 weeks - consider in DDx"
  - "Renal: Microscopic hematuria in 20-50% - determines long-term prognosis"
  - "Most resolve in 4-6 weeks; up to 1/3 have recurrence"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did rash appear? Started where?"
  - "Any joint pain or swelling?"
  - "Abdominal pain? Blood in stool?"
  - "Any blood in urine?"
  - "Any recent URI or strep infection?"
  - "Any testicular pain (boys)?"
  - "Any headache or confusion?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Rash: Palpable, non-blanching purpura - legs, buttocks"
  - "Joints: Swelling, tenderness (knees, ankles most common)"
  - "Abdominal tenderness, guarding"
  - "Scrotal exam in boys (orchitis)"
  - "Blood pressure (renal involvement)"
  - "Edema (nephrotic syndrome)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care: Rest, hydration, NSAIDs for joint pain"
  - "Corticosteroids: May help severe GI symptoms; don't prevent renal disease"
  - "Monitor: Urinalysis weekly for 4-6 weeks, then monthly for 6 months"
  - "Nephrology: If significant proteinuria, hypertension, or elevated creatinine"
  - "Surgery: If intussusception (usually ileocolic)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases with mild symptoms"
  - "Admit: Severe abdominal pain, GI bleeding, significant renal involvement"
  - "Labs: Urinalysis (everyone), BMP if renal concern, CBC"
  - "No imaging needed for typical presentation"
  - "Nephrology: Significant proteinuria, hypertension, rising creatinine"
  - "Follow urine: Weekly x4-6, then monthly x6 months, then periodic"
