red_flags:
  - "Paraphimosis (retracted foreskin trapped - emergency)"
  - "Urinary retention"
  - "Cellulitis extending to shaft or suprapubic area"
  - "Systemic illness (fever)"
  - "Recurrent episodes (consider diabetes)"
  - "Meatal stenosis"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Balanitis: inflammation of glans only"
  - "Balanoposthitis: inflammation of glans AND foreskin"
  - "Most common in uncircumcised boys"
  - "Causes: poor hygiene, irritants, infection (bacterial, candida)"
  - "Diaper dermatitis can cause balanitis in infants"
  - "Candida: white discharge, satellite lesions"
  - "Do NOT forcibly retract foreskin"
  - "Recurrent balanitis is indication for circumcision"

key_history_questions:
  - "Redness, swelling, discharge?"
  - "Pain with urination?"
  - "Able to urinate normally?"
  - "Recent irritants (soap, bubble bath)?"
  - "Foreskin retractable?"
  - "Previous episodes?"
  - "Recent antibiotics (candida risk)?"
  - "Diabetes?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Erythema of glans and/or foreskin"
  - "Swelling"
  - "Discharge (purulent or cheesy)"
  - "Foreskin appearance"
  - "Attempt gentle retraction (do not force)"
  - "Phimosis (can't retract)"
  - "Paraphimosis (foreskin stuck behind glans)"
  - "Meatal appearance"

treatment_principles:
  - "Hygiene: warm water soaks, gentle cleaning"
  - "Avoid irritants (bubble bath, harsh soaps)"
  - "Bacterial: topical mupirocin or oral cephalexin if more severe"
  - "Candidal: topical antifungal (clotrimazole, nystatin)"
  - "Topical steroid-antifungal combo can help with inflammation"
  - "Pain relief: warm soaks, NSAIDs"
  - "Foreskin care education"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All uncomplicated cases"
  - "Urgent urology: Paraphimosis, urinary retention"
  - "Urology referral: Recurrent balanitis (circumcision discussion)"
  - "Return: Not improving in 48-72 hours, worsening, unable to urinate"
  - "Screen for diabetes: If recurrent without clear cause"
