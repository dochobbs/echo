# Oral and Lip Lacerations - Teaching Framework
topic: "Oral and Lip Lacerations"
aliases: ["lip laceration", "tongue laceration", "mouth cut", "oral injury"]
category: trauma
age_range_months: [6, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know which oral lacerations need repair"
  - "Identify vermillion border injuries"
  - "Understand tongue laceration management"
  - "Recognize through-and-through lip injuries"
  - "Know which injuries can heal without sutures"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing through-and-through lip injury"
  - "Not aligning vermillion border precisely"
  - "Suturing small tongue lacerations (most heal)"
  - "Missing dental injuries"
  - "Not evaluating for foreign body"

red_flags:
  - "Uncontrolled bleeding"
  - "Through-and-through lip laceration"
  - "Large or gaping tongue laceration"
  - "Injury to floor of mouth (sublingual hematoma)"
  - "Associated dental injury"
  - "Deep injury near parotid duct or facial nerve"
  - "Signs of abuse"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Oral mucosa heals extremely well - many lacerations don't need sutures"
  - "Vermillion border: even 1mm mismatch is noticeable - repair carefully"
  - "Through-and-through: close in layers (mucosa, muscle, skin)"
  - "Tongue: most < 2cm, not gaping, edges approximate = no sutures"
  - "Tongue sutures: absorbable, may need sedation"
  - "Mucosal lacerations: absorbable sutures if needed"
  - "Oral wounds have low infection rate despite bacteria"
  - "Lip lacerations: good cosmetic alignment important"

key_history_questions:
  - "Mechanism - fall, bite, object?"
  - "When did it happen?"
  - "Bleeding controlled?"
  - "Any teeth loose, broken, or missing?"
  - "Could there be a foreign body?"
  - "Tetanus status?"
  - "For falls: concerning mechanism (abuse screen)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Bleeding controlled?"
  - "Location: lip, tongue, buccal mucosa, gingiva"
  - "Length and depth of laceration"
  - "Vermillion border involvement"
  - "Through-and-through (feel inside and out)"
  - "Foreign body (tooth fragment, debris)"
  - "Dental exam: loose, broken, missing teeth"
  - "Tongue: gaping? actively bleeding?"

treatment_principles:
  - "Pressure for bleeding control"
  - "Irrigate wound (saline)"
  - "Small mucosal lacerations (<1-2cm, not gaping): observation"
  - "Tongue: most heal without sutures"
  - "Tongue repair if: >2cm, gaping, bisecting edge, persistent bleeding"
  - "Vermillion border: meticulous alignment, fine suture (6-0)"
  - "Through-and-through: layered closure (mucosa-muscle-skin)"
  - "Sedation often needed for young children"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most oral lacerations"
  - "Repair indicated: Vermillion border, gaping, through-and-through, large tongue"
  - "Plastics/OMFS referral: Complex, cosmetically sensitive, parotid/nerve concern"
  - "Dental referral: Associated dental injuries"
  - "Follow-up: Large repairs 5-7 days"
  - "Diet: Soft foods, avoid straws, avoid citrus/spicy"
  - "Return: Persistent bleeding, signs of infection, wound opening"

parent_styles: [panicked-by-blood, cosmetically-concerned, worried-about-scarring]
