# Evaluation of Recurrent Infections - Teaching Framework
topic: "Recurrent Infections"
aliases: ["frequent infections", "immunodeficiency evaluation", "sick all the time"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish normal infection frequency from pathologic"
  - "Know warning signs of primary immunodeficiency"
  - "Order appropriate initial screening"
  - "Reassure appropriately when normal"

common_mistakes:
  - "Extensive workup for normal daycare illness frequency"
  - "Missing warning signs of immunodeficiency"
  - "Not checking vaccine titers as part of workup"
  - "Over-reassuring without thorough history"

red_flags:
  - "Need for IV antibiotics for infections"
  - ">2 serious bacterial infections (sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis)"
  - "Failure to thrive with infections"
  - "Infections with unusual organisms"
  - "Family history of early death from infection"

clinical_pearls:
  - "8-12 viral URIs/year in daycare is NORMAL"
  - "Warning signs: IV antibiotics needed, >2 deep infections, failure to thrive"
  - "Initial screen: CBC with diff, Immunoglobulins (IgG/A/M), Vaccine titers"
  - "Jeffrey Modell Foundation: 10 Warning Signs of Primary Immunodeficiency"

key_history_questions:
  - "How many infections in past year? What type?"
  - "Any hospitalizations or IV antibiotics?"
  - "Growth pattern - any concerns?"
  - "Daycare attendance?"
  - "Family history of immunodeficiency or early death?"
  - "Vaccination history and response?"
  - "Any unusual organisms isolated?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Growth parameters"
  - "Lymph node assessment"
  - "Tonsil size"
  - "Skin exam (eczema, abscesses)"
  - "Developmental assessment"

treatment_principles:
  - "Reassurance if normal frequency"
  - "Initial workup: CBC, IgG/A/M, vaccine titers"
  - "Immunology referral if abnormal screening or red flags"
  - "Optimize nutrition, sleep, daycare practices"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Initial evaluation and screening"
  - "Immunology referral: Abnormal screen, warning signs present"
  - "Reassurance: Normal infection frequency, healthy growth"

parent_styles: [worried, frustrated, wants-answers, wants-immune-boosters]
