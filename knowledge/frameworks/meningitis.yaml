# Meningitis (Bacterial & Viral) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Meningitis"
aliases: ["bacterial meningitis", "viral meningitis", "aseptic meningitis"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize when NOT to wait for LP to start antibiotics"
  - "Understand role of steroids in bacterial meningitis"
  - "Know limitations of clinical signs"
  - "Differentiate bacterial from viral meningitis"

common_mistakes:
  - "Delaying antibiotics for LP or CT"
  - "Giving steroids after first antibiotic dose (less effective)"
  - "Relying on Kernig/Brudzinski signs (specific but not sensitive)"
  - "Missing meningitis in young infant (atypical presentation)"

red_flags:
  - "Altered mental status"
  - "Bulging fontanelle"
  - "Petechial/purpuric rash"
  - "Seizures"
  - "Signs of increased ICP"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Kernig/Brudzinski are SPECIFIC but NOT sensitive - don't rule out meningitis"
  - "Fever + Altered Mental Status = key combination"
  - "Start empiric antibiotics IMMEDIATELY - do NOT wait for LP if unstable"
  - "Dexamethasone for H. flu and Pneumococcal meningitis - give BEFORE or WITH first antibiotic"

key_history_questions:
  - "Fever duration and pattern?"
  - "Headache, neck stiffness?"
  - "Vomiting?"
  - "Mental status changes?"
  - "Seizures?"
  - "Recent sick contacts?"
  - "Vaccination status (Hib, Pneumococcal, Meningococcal)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Mental status"
  - "Nuchal rigidity"
  - "Kernig sign (painful knee extension with hip flexed)"
  - "Brudzinski sign (neck flexion causes hip flexion)"
  - "Fontanelle (bulging in infants)"
  - "Petechiae/purpura"
  - "Focal neurologic findings"

treatment_principles:
  - "Empiric antibiotics: Vancomycin + Ceftriaxone (add Ampicillin if <1 month)"
  - "Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg q6h x 2-4 days - give before/with first antibiotic"
  - "LP after stabilization if no contraindication"
  - "Head CT before LP if concern for increased ICP"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit: All suspected bacterial meningitis to ICU"
  - "Admit: Viral meningitis if unable to tolerate PO or severe symptoms"
  - "Outpatient: Mild viral meningitis with reliable follow-up"

parent_styles: [terrified, wants-answers, concerned-about-long-term]
