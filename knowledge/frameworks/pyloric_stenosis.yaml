# Pyloric Stenosis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis"
aliases: ["pyloric stenosis", "projectile vomiting", "pyloric"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [0, 3]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic presentation of 'hungry vomiter'"
  - "Know expected electrolyte abnormalities"
  - "Understand this is a MEDICAL emergency before surgical"
  - "Order appropriate imaging"

common_mistakes:
  - "Taking to OR before fluid resuscitation and electrolyte correction"
  - "Missing diagnosis due to atypical presentation"
  - "Confusing with GERD"
  - "Not recognizing dehydration severity"

red_flags:
  - "Bilious vomiting (NOT pyloric stenosis - consider malrotation)"
  - "Severe dehydration"
  - "Lethargy from electrolyte imbalance"
  - "Hypoglycemia"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic: Projectile NON-BILIOUS vomiting, 3-6 weeks, 'Hungry Vomiter'"
  - "Electrolytes: Hypochloremic, Hypokalemic Metabolic ALKALOSIS"
  - "Ultrasound is gold standard imaging"
  - "Fluid resuscitation/electrolyte correction MUST occur BEFORE surgery"
  - "It is a MEDICAL emergency first, SURGICAL second"

key_history_questions:
  - "Age at onset of vomiting?"
  - "Projectile or just spitting up?"
  - "Any bile (green) in vomit?"
  - "Does baby want to eat after vomiting?"
  - "Number of wet diapers? Weight loss?"
  - "Family history of pyloric stenosis?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Dehydration assessment"
  - "Visible gastric peristalsis (waves across abdomen)"
  - "'Olive' - palpable pyloric mass in RUQ (rarely felt)"
  - "Fontanelle (sunken if dehydrated)"
  - "Capillary refill"

treatment_principles:
  - "NPO and IV fluid resuscitation"
  - "Correct electrolyte abnormalities before surgery"
  - "Target: Chloride >100, Potassium normalized, pH <7.45"
  - "Pyloromyotomy after medical stabilization"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit: All suspected pyloric stenosis"
  - "Surgery: After fluid and electrolyte correction"
  - "NEVER: Take to OR before medical stabilization"

differential_diagnosis:
  - "GERD"
  - "Malrotation with volvulus (bilious - emergency)"
  - "Overfeeding"
  - "Formula intolerance"

parent_styles: [worried, exhausted, frustrated]
