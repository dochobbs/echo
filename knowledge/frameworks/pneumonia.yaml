# Community-Acquired Pneumonia - Teaching Framework
topic: "Community-Acquired Pneumonia"
aliases: ["CAP", "pneumonia", "walking pneumonia"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [3, 180]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish bacterial vs viral vs atypical pneumonia"
  - "Know when imaging is indicated vs clinical diagnosis"
  - "Choose appropriate empiric antibiotic by age group"
  - "Recognize severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization"
  - "Understand the role of Mycoplasma in school-age children"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering CXR for every child with cough and fever"
  - "Missing atypical pneumonia in school-age kids"
  - "Using azithromycin as first-line in young children"
  - "Not considering parapneumonic effusion"
  - "Underdosing amoxicillin"

red_flags:
  - "Hypoxia (SpO2 <92%)"
  - "Severe respiratory distress"
  - "Toxic appearance"
  - "Pleural effusion on exam or imaging"
  - "Failed outpatient therapy"
  - "Immunocompromised host"

clinical_pearls:
  - "High-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/day) is first-line for bacterial CAP"
  - "Mycoplasma peaks at age 5-15 - think azithromycin here"
  - "Focal findings on exam (decreased breath sounds, crackles) → CXR"
  - "Viral pneumonia is most common in <5 year olds"
  - "Round pneumonia is classic in young children - don't call it a mass"

key_history_questions:
  - "Fever duration and pattern?"
  - "Cough - productive or dry?"
  - "Breathing fast or working hard?"
  - "Able to eat and drink?"
  - "Sick contacts? School/daycare exposures?"
  - "Vaccination status (PCV13, influenza)?"
  - "Any previous pneumonias?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Respiratory rate (tachypnea is sensitive)"
  - "Oxygen saturation"
  - "Work of breathing"
  - "Auscultation (focal crackles, decreased breath sounds)"
  - "Dullness to percussion"
  - "Egophony"

treatment_principles:
  - "<5 years: High-dose amoxicillin (presumed S. pneumoniae)"
  - ">5 years: Consider Mycoplasma - may add azithromycin"
  - "Penicillin allergy: Cefdinir or levofloxacin"
  - "Duration: 5-7 days for uncomplicated"
  - "No routine follow-up CXR needed"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit: Hypoxia, severe distress, failed oral therapy, effusion"
  - "Outpatient: Well-appearing, tolerating PO, SpO2 >92%, reliable follow-up"

parent_styles: [worried, daycare-concerned, antibiotic-experienced]
