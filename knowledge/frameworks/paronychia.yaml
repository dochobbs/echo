# Paronychia and Felon - Teaching Framework
topic: "Paronychia and Felon"
aliases: ["paronychia", "felon", "finger infection", "nail infection", "whitlow"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish paronychia from felon"
  - "Know when drainage is needed"
  - "Recognize herpetic whitlow"
  - "Perform appropriate drainage technique"
  - "Identify chronic paronychia"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing felon (deep pulp space infection)"
  - "Incising herpetic whitlow (contraindicated)"
  - "Inadequate drainage of established abscess"
  - "Not recognizing chronic paronychia"
  - "Antibiotic-only treatment for abscess"

red_flags:
  - "Felon: tense, very painful pulp"
  - "Flexor tenosynovitis (finger held flexed, pain with passive extension)"
  - "Lymphangitis or spreading cellulitis"
  - "Osteomyelitis concern"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"
  - "Vesicles (herpetic whitlow)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Paronychia: infection of lateral nail fold"
  - "Felon: infection of finger pulp (volar fat pad)"
  - "Acute paronychia: S. aureus most common"
  - "Chronic paronychia: Candida, often in thumb-suckers"
  - "Herpetic whitlow: vesicles, very painful, do NOT incise"
  - "Drainage needed if fluctuance present"
  - "Felon requires incision of septae in pulp space"

key_history_questions:
  - "How long has it been there?"
  - "Getting worse?"
  - "Nail biting or thumb sucking?"
  - "Any injury - hangnail, splinter?"
  - "Pus draining?"
  - "Previous episodes?"
  - "Any vesicles or blisters?"
  - "Fever?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Paronychia: erythema, swelling at lateral nail fold"
  - "Felon: tense, swollen finger pulp (pad)"
  - "Fluctuance"
  - "Point of maximal tenderness"
  - "Vesicles (herpetic whitlow)"
  - "Kanavel signs (flexor tenosynovitis): finger flexed, fusiform swelling, pain with passive extension, tenderness along sheath"

treatment_principles:
  - "Early paronychia (no pus): warm soaks, antibiotics"
  - "Paronychia with abscess: drainage - lift nail fold with blade"
  - "Felon: formal I&D, break up septae"
  - "Antibiotics: cephalexin or TMP-SMX if MRSA concern"
  - "Chronic paronychia: topical antifungal, keep dry"
  - "Herpetic whitlow: supportive only, do NOT incise"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Simple paronychia with or without drainage"
  - "Hand surgery referral: Felon (can be done in ED by trained provider)"
  - "Urgent hand surgery: Flexor tenosynovitis"
  - "Follow-up: 48 hours for wound check"
  - "Return: Worsening, fever, not improving"
