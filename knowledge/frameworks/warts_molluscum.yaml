# Warts and Molluscum - Teaching Framework
topic: "Warts and Molluscum Contagiosum"
aliases: ["verruca", "common warts", "molluscum", "water warts"]
category: derm
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize these are self-limited conditions"
  - "Avoid over-treatment in immunocompetent children"
  - "Know when treatment is warranted"
  - "Counsel families on realistic timeline"

common_mistakes:
  - "Aggressive treatment causing more harm than the lesions"
  - "Not counseling on self-resolution (especially molluscum)"
  - "Sending for cryotherapy for every wart"
  - "Missing extensive molluscum as sign of immunodeficiency"

red_flags:
  - "Extensive molluscum (>100 lesions) - consider immunodeficiency"
  - "Giant molluscum (>1 cm)"
  - "Facial/genital warts in young children (consider abuse)"
  - "Warts unresponsive to treatment (immunocompromised)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Molluscum: Umbilicated (central dimple) pearly papules - SELF-LIMITED in 6-18 months"
  - "Warts: Rough, hyperkeratotic; disrupt skin lines; pinpoint bleeding when pared"
  - "Watchful waiting is reasonable for both in immunocompetent children"
  - "Treatment indicated: Pain, interference with function, psychosocial distress"

key_history_questions:
  - "How long have lesions been present?"
  - "Are they spreading? To others?"
  - "Any pain or itching?"
  - "Previous treatments tried?"
  - "Impact on child's life (embarrassment, activities)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Molluscum: 2-5mm umbilicated papules, often in clusters"
  - "Warts: Rough, verrucous surface; interrupt dermatoglyphics"
  - "Distribution (plantar, periungual, genital)"
  - "Signs of inflammation or secondary infection"

treatment_principles:
  - "Watchful waiting is first-line for molluscum in healthy children"
  - "Molluscum: Curettage, cantharidin (if treating)"
  - "Warts: Salicylic acid (OTC) first-line, cryotherapy if needed"
  - "Plantar warts: Duct tape occlusion + salicylic acid"
  - "Avoid painful treatments in young children if lesions not bothersome"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Dermatology referral: Refractory, extensive, atypical location"
  - "Counsel: Self-resolution expected; treatment not mandatory"
  - "Immunology: If extensive with other infections"

parent_styles: [wants-immediate-treatment, concerned-about-contagion, patient-with-observation]
