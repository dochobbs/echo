# Intussusception - Teaching Framework
topic: "Intussusception"
aliases: ["intussusception", "telescoping bowel"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [3, 36]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic triad (even though complete triad uncommon)"
  - "Know ultrasound is diagnostic test of choice"
  - "Understand air enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic"
  - "Identify lead point concerns in older children"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing diagnosis when currant jelly stool absent (late finding)"
  - "Getting CT instead of ultrasound"
  - "Not considering in infant with intermittent inconsolable crying"
  - "Missing lead point in children >2-3 years"

red_flags:
  - "Signs of perforation or peritonitis"
  - "Prolonged symptoms (>48-72 hours)"
  - "Bilious vomiting"
  - "Hemodynamic instability"
  - "Palpable mass"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Peak age: 6-18 months - classic triad (colicky pain, vomiting, bloody stool) in only 20%"
  - "Intermittent, severe, colicky abdominal pain with pain-free intervals"
  - "Ultrasound: Target/doughnut sign diagnostic"
  - "Air enema: Diagnostic AND therapeutic - 85-90% success rate"
  - "Lead point: More likely if age >2-3 years (Meckel's, polyp, lymphoma)"

key_history_questions:
  - "Describe the episodes - sudden onset? Severe?"
  - "Pain-free intervals between episodes?"
  - "Vomiting? Bilious?"
  - "Stools - any blood or mucus (currant jelly)?"
  - "Last normal stool?"
  - "Recent illness? (Post-viral most common trigger)"
  - "Normal appetite and activity between episodes?"
  - "Age of child?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Assess hydration and hemodynamic status"
  - "Abdominal exam - 'sausage-shaped' mass in RUQ"
  - "Empty RLQ (Dance's sign)"
  - "Lethargy (may be striking between episodes)"
  - "Rectal exam - blood on glove (late finding)"
  - "Signs of peritonitis"

treatment_principles:
  - "NPO, IV fluids, NG if vomiting"
  - "Ultrasound for diagnosis"
  - "Air or contrast enema: Reduction - 85-90% success"
  - "Surgical consultation (before or concurrent with enema)"
  - "Surgery: If enema fails, perforation, peritonitis, or shock"
  - "Admit for observation after successful reduction (recurrence 5-10%)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "ED: All suspected cases"
  - "Radiology: Ultrasound first, then therapeutic enema"
  - "Surgery: Consult for all confirmed cases"
  - "Admit: After reduction for observation (24-48 hours)"
  - "Workup for lead point: If age >3 years or recurrent"
