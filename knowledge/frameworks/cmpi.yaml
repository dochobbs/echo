# Cow's Milk Protein Intolerance (CMPI) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Cow's Milk Protein Intolerance"
aliases: ["CMPI", "milk protein allergy", "CMPA", "food protein proctocolitis"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [0, 12]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize typical presentation of CMPI"
  - "Understand this is NOT IgE-mediated anaphylaxis"
  - "Know appropriate formula choices"
  - "Counsel on resolution timeline"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering IgE testing for CMPI (wrong mechanism)"
  - "Switching to soy formula (30-50% cross-reactivity)"
  - "Unnecessary restriction of maternal diet beyond dairy"
  - "Delaying reintroduction past 12 months"

red_flags:
  - "Severe failure to thrive"
  - "Anaphylactic symptoms (this is IgE allergy, not CMPI)"
  - "Profuse bloody diarrhea"
  - "FPIES symptoms (repetitive vomiting hours after feeding)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic presentation: Healthy, THRIVING infant with blood-streaked stools"
  - "This is NOT anaphylaxis (IgE-mediated) - it's cell-mediated"
  - "30-50% soy cross-reactivity → go straight to extensively hydrolyzed formula"
  - "90% resolve by age 1 year - can trial reintroduction"
  - "For breastfed infants: maternal dairy elimination"

key_history_questions:
  - "Describe the stools - frequency, consistency, blood?"
  - "Is baby gaining weight normally?"
  - "Breast or formula fed?"
  - "Any other symptoms - fussiness, eczema, vomiting?"
  - "Family history of allergies?"
  - "Any reactions to direct milk exposure?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Growth parameters (typically normal in CMPI)"
  - "Abdominal exam"
  - "Perianal exam for fissures"
  - "Skin exam for eczema"
  - "Hydration status"

treatment_principles:
  - "Breastfed: Maternal dairy elimination (allow 2-4 weeks)"
  - "Formula-fed: Switch to extensively hydrolyzed (Alimentum, Nutramigen)"
  - "Skip soy - high cross-reactivity"
  - "Amino acid formula if hydrolyzed fails"
  - "Trial reintroduction around 12 months"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Typical presentation, thriving infant"
  - "Follow-up: Confirm symptom resolution with diet change"
  - "GI referral: Severe symptoms, failure to thrive, failed diet trials"

parent_styles: [anxious, dairy-avoidant, wants-testing]
