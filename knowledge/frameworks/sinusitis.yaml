# Sinusitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Acute Bacterial Sinusitis"
aliases: ["sinus infection", "rhinosinusitis"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Apply AAP diagnostic criteria (persistent, severe, worsening)"
  - "Distinguish bacterial sinusitis from viral URI"
  - "Know when antibiotics are indicated"
  - "Understand appropriate first-line antibiotic choice"
  - "Recognize complications requiring urgent referral"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating every URI with antibiotics"
  - "Diagnosing sinusitis too early (< 10 days symptoms)"
  - "Ordering imaging for uncomplicated sinusitis"
  - "Using decongestants in young children"
  - "Not recognizing orbital complications"

red_flags:
  - "Periorbital edema or erythema (orbital cellulitis)"
  - "Proptosis or limited eye movement"
  - "Severe headache or altered mental status"
  - "High fever with toxic appearance"
  - "Frontal swelling (Pott's puffy tumor)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "3 patterns suggest bacterial: persistent (>10 days), severe onset, worsening (double-sickening)"
  - "Color of nasal discharge does NOT distinguish viral from bacterial"
  - "Maxillary sinuses develop by age 4, frontal by age 7-8"
  - "Imaging NOT recommended for uncomplicated acute sinusitis"
  - "Most bacterial sinusitis is from S. pneumoniae, H. flu, M. catarrhalis"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of symptoms?"
  - "Pattern: persistent, severe onset, or worsening?"
  - "Fever history?"
  - "Facial pain or pressure?"
  - "Nasal discharge character?"
  - "Cough (especially nocturnal)?"
  - "Any eye swelling or vision changes?"
  - "Recent antibiotics?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Nasal mucosa and discharge"
  - "Facial tenderness (unreliable in children)"
  - "Periorbital area - any swelling or erythema"
  - "Throat - postnasal drip"
  - "Transillumination (limited utility)"
  - "Eye movements if orbital concern"

treatment_principles:
  - "First-line: high-dose amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg/day)"
  - "Amox-clav if: recent antibiotics, daycare, or treatment failure"
  - "Duration: 10-14 days (or 7 days after improvement)"
  - "Adjuncts: saline irrigation, pain control"
  - "Avoid oral decongestants in young children"
  - "No role for routine antihistamines or mucolytics"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Uncomplicated sinusitis"
  - "Urgent evaluation: Orbital symptoms, severe headache, toxic appearance"
  - "ENT referral: Recurrent sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, anatomic concerns"
  - "Follow-up in 48-72 hours if no improvement"
