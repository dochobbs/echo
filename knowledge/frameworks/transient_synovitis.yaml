# Transient Synovitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Transient Synovitis"
aliases: ["toxic synovitis", "irritable hip", "observation hip"]
category: musculoskeletal
age_range_months: [18, 120]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish transient synovitis from septic arthritis"
  - "Apply Kocher criteria appropriately"
  - "Know when joint aspiration is indicated"
  - "Understand natural history and treatment"
  - "Recognize when further workup needed"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing septic arthritis"
  - "Over-investigating classic transient synovitis"
  - "Not following up to ensure resolution"
  - "Missing Legg-Calve-Perthes as cause of persistent symptoms"
  - "Not considering referred pain from spine or knee"

red_flags:
  - "Fever (septic arthritis)"
  - "Inability to bear weight at all"
  - "Severely ill appearance"
  - "Elevated WBC, ESR, CRP"
  - "Not improving in 24-48 hours"
  - "Symptoms persisting > 10 days"
  - "Infant or very young child (higher septic risk)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Peak age: 3-8 years, more common in boys"
  - "Often follows viral illness"
  - "Hip held in flexion, abduction, external rotation"
  - "Kocher criteria: non-weight bearing, fever, WBC>12k, ESR>40"
  - "0 criteria: <0.2% septic risk"
  - "4 criteria: 99% septic risk - aspirate"
  - "Usually unilateral (bilateral think other diagnosis)"
  - "Self-limited: resolves in 1-2 weeks"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did limp/pain start?"
  - "Recent viral illness?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Able to walk or bear weight?"
  - "Hip, thigh, or knee pain?"
  - "Any trauma?"
  - "Previous similar episodes?"
  - "How is child acting - playful or ill?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Limp or refusal to walk"
  - "Hip ROM - limited internal rotation most sensitive"
  - "Hip held in flexion, abduction, external rotation"
  - "Pain with log roll of leg"
  - "Temperature"
  - "Exam of knee, spine (referred pain)"
  - "General appearance - well vs ill"

treatment_principles:
  - "NSAIDs (ibuprofen) for pain and inflammation"
  - "Rest and limited weight bearing as tolerated"
  - "No antibiotics (this is not infectious)"
  - "Usually resolves in 7-10 days"
  - "If Kocher criteria suggest septic arthritis: aspirate"
  - "Follow-up to ensure resolution"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Classic presentation, 0-1 Kocher criteria"
  - "Labs: Consider CBC, ESR, CRP if any concern for septic"
  - "Ultrasound: Can confirm effusion"
  - "Aspiration: If septic arthritis cannot be excluded"
  - "Follow-up: 48-72 hours to ensure improving"
  - "X-ray: If symptoms persist >10 days (Perthes, SCFE)"
  - "Orthopedics: Septic concern, not improving, recurrent"
