teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic scabies distribution"
  - "Understand scabies treatment includes whole family"
  - "Know nit removal is cosmetic, not medical necessity"
  - "Apply evidence-based lice treatment"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating only symptomatic patient for scabies (need all contacts)"
  - "Over-treating head lice with multiple agents"

red_flags:

  - "Secondary bacterial superinfection"
  - "Widespread excoriations with risk of impetigo"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Scabies: Pruritus WORSE at night, web spaces, waistline, genitals"
  - "Scabies in INFANTS: Head and neck involved (unlike adults)"
  - "Permethrin 5% for scabies - apply neck to toes, leave on 8-14 hours, repeat in 1 week"
  - "Head lice: Live lice = active infestation; nits alone may be old"
  - "No-nit policies are NOT recommended - nits don't spread disease"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did itching start? Worse at night?"
  - "Anyone else in household itching?"
  - "Any new contacts or sleepovers?"
  - "What treatments have been tried?"
  - "Any pets? (they don't carry human scabies)"

  - "Scabies: Burrows, papules in web spaces, wrists, waistline"
  - "Infants: May have face/scalp involvement, vesicles on palms/soles"
  - "Lice: Live lice on scalp, nits cemented to hair shaft"
  - "Secondary changes: excoriations, impetiginization"

treatment_principles:
  - "Scabies: Permethrin 5% cream, apply everywhere below chin, wash off in 8-14 hours"
  - "Scabies: REPEAT in 1 week, treat ALL household contacts simultaneously"
  - "Lice: Permethrin 1% (OTC) or malathion if resistant"
  - "Lice: Wet combing with fine-tooth comb every 3-4 days x 2 weeks"
  - "Wash bedding/clothing in hot water; bag items that can't be washed x 2 weeks"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "No school exclusion for nits - can return after treatment started"
  - "Dermatology: Crusted scabies, treatment failure"
  - "Follow-up: 2-4 weeks if symptoms persist"
