# Type 1 Diabetes Sick Day Management - Teaching Framework
topic: "Type 1 Diabetes Sick Day Management"
aliases: ["DKA prevention", "sick day rules", "T1D sick day"]
category: endocrine
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know NEVER to stop insulin during illness"
  - "Teach ketone monitoring and fluid management"
  - "Recognize DKA warning signs"
  - "Counsel families proactively"

common_mistakes:
  - "Stopping insulin because child isn't eating"
  - "Not checking ketones during illness"
  - "Waiting too long to contact endocrinology"
  - "Not having sick day supplies at home"

red_flags:
  - "Moderate-large ketones not improving with fluids and correction"
  - "Persistent vomiting (can't keep fluids down)"
  - "Altered mental status, Kussmaul respirations"
  - "Glucose persistently >300 despite correction"
  - "Severe abdominal pain"

clinical_pearls:
  - "NEVER stop insulin - illness increases need even if not eating"
  - "Check glucose every 2-4 hours; check ketones if glucose >250"
  - "Fluids are critical - push sugar-free if glucose high, regular if low"
  - "Give correction insulin for ketones even if glucose not severely elevated"
  - "Rule of 15: If glucose <100, give 15g carbs, recheck in 15 minutes"

key_history_questions:
  - "What is the illness? Fever, vomiting, diarrhea?"
  - "Can child keep fluids down?"
  - "What was last glucose? Trend?"
  - "Any ketones? What level?"
  - "What insulin has been given today?"
  - "Normal basal rates? (if on pump)"
  - "Any signs of DKA (deep breathing, confusion, severe abdominal pain)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Hydration status"
  - "Respiratory pattern (Kussmaul = deep, labored)"
  - "Mental status"
  - "Abdominal exam"
  - "Point-of-care glucose if available"
  - "Source of illness (URI, gastroenteritis)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Continue basal insulin ALWAYS"
  - "Correction insulin every 2-4 hours based on glucose and ketones"
  - "Fluids: 1-2 oz every 15-30 min; sugar-free if glucose >250, regular if <150"
  - "Extra 5-10% of TDD as rapid-acting insulin for ketones"
  - "Contact endocrinology if: Moderate-large ketones, persistent vomiting, glucose not responding"
  - "ED if: Can't keep fluids down, moderate-large ketones not improving, altered mental status"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Home management: Mild illness, small or negative ketones, able to drink"
  - "Contact endo team: Moderate ketones, not improving, uncertain what to do"
  - "ED: Persistent vomiting, moderate-large ketones, signs of DKA"
  - "Admit: DKA (glucose >250 + ketones + acidosis)"
  - "Proactive education: All T1D families need sick day training"

parent_styles: [panicked, experienced-confident, forgetting-rules]
