# Inguinal Hernia and Hydrocele - Teaching Framework
topic: "Inguinal Hernia and Hydrocele"
aliases: ["inguinal hernia", "hydrocele", "scrotal swelling"]
category: urology
age_range_months: [0, 36]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish hernia from hydrocele on exam"
  - "Know hernia requires surgical repair"
  - "Recognize incarcerated hernia as emergency"
  - "Understand most hydroceles resolve spontaneously"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing inguinal hernia (intermittent finding)"
  - "Not recognizing incarcerated hernia"
  - "Ordering imaging when diagnosis is clinical"
  - "Failing to refer hernia for surgical repair"

red_flags:
  - "Incarcerated hernia: Firm, tender, irreducible, with vomiting"
  - "Discoloration of overlying skin"
  - "Inconsolable crying with groin mass"
  - "Communicating hydrocele persisting beyond 1-2 years"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Hydrocele: Transilluminates, scrotal only, non-tender; most resolve by 12-18 months"
  - "Hernia: Extends to inguinal canal, reducible, may increase with crying/straining"
  - "Incarcerated: Can't reduce - emergency; ischemia → strangulation"
  - "Premature infants: Higher risk of hernia; may need early repair"
  - "Girls can have hernias too - ovary may be in hernia sac"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did swelling appear? Intermittent?"
  - "Worse with crying, straining, activity?"
  - "Any pain? Fussiness?"
  - "Vomiting? Feeding normally?"
  - "Has it ever been hard to reduce?"
  - "Prematurity?"
  - "Family history of hernias?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Inspect groin and scrotum"
  - "Transillumination (hydrocele positive, hernia may not)"
  - "Palpate: Extends to inguinal canal? (Hernia)"
  - "Can you reduce it? (Reducible hernia vs incarcerated)"
  - "Tenderness? (Concerning if tender)"
  - "'Silk glove sign': Thickened spermatic cord on affected side"
  - "Exam with increased abdominal pressure (crying, standing)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Communicating hydrocele: Observation; most resolve by 12-18 months"
  - "Non-communicating hydrocele: Also observe; may persist longer"
  - "Inguinal hernia: Surgical repair (elective if reducible)"
  - "Incarcerated hernia: Urgent reduction attempt, then emergent surgery"
  - "Premature infants: May need repair before NICU discharge"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Surgical referral: All inguinal hernias - even if asymptomatic"
  - "Emergent: Incarcerated hernia, signs of obstruction"
  - "Hydrocele: Observe; refer if persists beyond 12-18 months or communicating"
  - "Ultrasound: Usually not needed if diagnosis clear on exam"
  - "Follow-up: Until resolved or surgically repaired"
