# Torticollis & Plagiocephaly - Teaching Framework
topic: "Torticollis & Plagiocephaly"
aliases: ["flat head", "positional plagiocephaly", "congenital torticollis"]
category: newborn
age_range_months: [0, 12]

teaching_goals:
  - "Understand cause-effect relationship between torticollis and plagiocephaly"
  - "Know when helmet therapy is indicated vs not"
  - "Recognize craniosynostosis red flags"
  - "Initiate appropriate PT referral"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating plagiocephaly before addressing torticollis"
  - "Referring for helmet in mild/moderate cases (PT is equally effective)"
  - "Missing craniosynostosis in persistent flat spot"
  - "Not starting PT early enough"

red_flags:
  - "Palpable ridge along suture (craniosynostosis)"
  - "Flat spot not improving with repositioning"
  - "Torticollis not improving with stretching"
  - "Associated developmental delays"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Tight SCM (torticollis) locks head → flat spot develops (plagiocephaly)"
  - "TREAT THE NECK FIRST with PT/stretching"
  - "Helmet therapy is controversial - repositioning + PT as effective for mild/moderate"
  - "Helmets reserved for severe cases or late presentation (>6-8 months)"
  - "If flat spot doesn't improve or ridge is palpable → Head CT for craniosynostosis"

key_history_questions:
  - "Which direction does baby prefer to look?"
  - "Any difficulty with tummy time?"
  - "Where does baby sleep - always same position?"
  - "Birth history - prolonged labor, positioning?"
  - "Has flat spot improved or worsened?"
  - "Developmental milestones on track?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Head shape - parallelogram vs brachycephaly"
  - "Palpation of sutures for ridges"
  - "SCM tightness and passive ROM"
  - "Facial asymmetry"
  - "Active head rotation"
  - "Ear alignment"

treatment_principles:
  - "PT referral for stretching exercises - first line"
  - "Repositioning (alternate head position, tummy time)"
  - "Helmet: Severe cases, late presentation (>6-8 months)"
  - "Craniosynostosis: Neurosurgery referral"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: PT referral for torticollis"
  - "Follow-up: Monitor head shape improvement"
  - "Specialist referral: Not improving, concern for craniosynostosis"
  - "Craniosynostosis workup: Palpable ridge, progressive deformity"

parent_styles: [worried-about-appearance, wants-helmet, patient]
