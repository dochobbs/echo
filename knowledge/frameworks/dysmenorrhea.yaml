# Dysmenorrhea and Endometriosis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Dysmenorrhea and Endometriosis"
aliases: ["dysmenorrhea", "period pain", "menstrual cramps", "endometriosis"]
category: adolescent
age_range_months: [120, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish primary from secondary dysmenorrhea"
  - "Know first-line treatment is NSAIDs and/or hormonal contraception"
  - "Recognize endometriosis in adolescents"
  - "Understand when to refer to gynecology"

common_mistakes:
  - "Dismissing adolescent menstrual pain as 'normal'"
  - "Not prescribing NSAIDs on a scheduled basis"
  - "Missing endometriosis (can present in teens)"
  - "Not offering hormonal therapy for moderate-severe dysmenorrhea"

red_flags:
  - "Pain unresponsive to NSAIDs + hormonal therapy"
  - "Progressive worsening over time"
  - "Pain throughout cycle (not just menstrual)"
  - "GI or urinary symptoms with menses"
  - "School absences due to menstrual pain"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Primary dysmenorrhea: Starts within 2 years of menarche, no pelvic pathology"
  - "Secondary dysmenorrhea: Suggests underlying cause (endometriosis, structural)"
  - "NSAIDs: Start 1-2 days BEFORE menses begins, scheduled (not PRN)"
  - "Hormonal therapy: Continuous OCPs (skip placebo) or hormonal IUD for refractory cases"
  - "Endometriosis affects 11% of women; underdiagnosed in adolescents"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did periods start? When did pain start?"
  - "Describe pain: Timing, severity, location, duration?"
  - "School missed? Activities limited?"
  - "Pain between periods?"
  - "GI symptoms with menses (diarrhea, constipation, nausea)?"
  - "Urinary symptoms with menses?"
  - "Current treatments tried? Response?"
  - "Family history of endometriosis or fibroids?"
  - "Sexual activity?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Often normal in primary dysmenorrhea"
  - "Abdominal exam: Tenderness, masses"
  - "Pelvic exam if sexually active or severe: Adnexal masses, uterosacral nodularity"
  - "External genital exam: Rule out outflow obstruction"

treatment_principles:
  - "First-line: NSAIDs (ibuprofen 400-600mg q6-8h, naproxen 500mg BID) - start 1-2 days before menses"
  - "Second-line: Add hormonal contraception (OCPs, patch, ring, hormonal IUD)"
  - "Continuous hormonal therapy: Skip placebo to prevent withdrawal bleeding"
  - "Hormonal IUD (Mirena): Excellent for dysmenorrhea, especially if also needing contraception"
  - "Heat, exercise, TENS: Adjunctive therapies"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "No imaging needed for typical primary dysmenorrhea"
  - "Ultrasound: If concern for structural abnormality"
  - "Gynecology referral: Unresponsive to NSAIDs + hormonal therapy, suspected endometriosis"
  - "Laparoscopy: Only way to definitively diagnose endometriosis"
  - "Follow-up: 3 months to assess treatment response"

parent_styles: [dismissive-of-pain, very-involved, wants-answers-quickly]
