# ITP - Teaching Framework
topic: "Immune Thrombocytopenia"
aliases: ["ITP", "idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura", "immune thrombocytopenic purpura"]
category: hematology
age_range_months: [12, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic presentation in otherwise well child"
  - "Distinguish from leukemia and other serious causes"
  - "Know when bone marrow biopsy is indicated"
  - "Understand treatment thresholds"
  - "Counsel on activity restrictions and bleeding precautions"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing leukemia or aplastic anemia"
  - "Over-treating mild ITP"
  - "Not checking for other cytopenias"
  - "Unnecessary bone marrow biopsy in classic cases"
  - "Over-restricting activity"

red_flags:
  - "Abnormalities in other cell lines (WBC, RBC)"
  - "Lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly"
  - "Bone pain"
  - "Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss)"
  - "Not responding to treatment"
  - "Intracranial hemorrhage symptoms (headache, altered mental status)"
  - "Atypical age (< 1 year or adolescent)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Peak age: 2-6 years"
  - "Often 1-4 weeks after viral illness"
  - "Isolated thrombocytopenia - other lines normal"
  - "Otherwise well-appearing child"
  - "Petechiae, purpura, bruising without other symptoms"
  - "No hepatosplenomegaly (if present, think leukemia)"
  - "Platelet count often < 20,000 at diagnosis"
  - "Bleeding risk correlates poorly with platelet count"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did bruising/petechiae start?"
  - "Any recent viral illness?"
  - "Any bleeding - nose, gums, blood in stool/urine?"
  - "Fever, weight loss, bone pain, fatigue?"
  - "Any new medications?"
  - "Family history of bleeding disorders or autoimmune conditions?"
  - "How is the child acting - sick or well?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Petechiae (especially dependent areas, oral mucosa)"
  - "Purpura and ecchymoses"
  - "NO lymphadenopathy"
  - "NO hepatosplenomegaly"
  - "NO pallor (unless significant bleeding)"
  - "Otherwise well-appearing child"
  - "Signs of mucosal bleeding"

treatment_principles:
  - "Observation often appropriate if platelet > 20,000 and no bleeding"
  - "Treatment if: platelets < 10-20k, significant bleeding, or upcoming procedure"
  - "IVIG: 0.8-1 g/kg - rapid platelet rise"
  - "Corticosteroids: prednisone 2-4 mg/kg/day"
  - "Anti-D (WinRho): if Rh-positive, non-splenectomized"
  - "Activity restriction: avoid contact sports, helmets for toddlers"
  - "Avoid NSAIDs and aspirin"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Platelet > 10-20k, no significant bleeding, reliable follow-up"
  - "Admission: Active bleeding, very low platelets, uncertain diagnosis"
  - "Hematology consultation: All new diagnoses"
  - "Bone marrow: Atypical features, not responding, before steroids if any doubt"
  - "Follow-up: Weekly CBC until stable, then less frequent"
  - "Education: Bleeding precautions, when to return"
