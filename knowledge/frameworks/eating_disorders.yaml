# Eating Disorders - Teaching Framework
topic: "Eating Disorders"
aliases: ["anorexia nervosa", "bulimia", "ARFID", "binge eating"]
category: behavioral
age_range_months: [96, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize medical instability requiring hospitalization"
  - "Know vital sign and lab criteria for admission"
  - "Screen routinely in adolescents"
  - "Understand FBT is first-line for adolescent anorexia"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing eating disorder in normal-weight patient"
  - "Not checking orthostatic vitals"
  - "Reassuring based on 'not underweight enough'"
  - "Not involving family in treatment"

red_flags:
  - "Heart rate <50 awake or <45 asleep"
  - "Blood pressure <80/50 or orthostatic changes"
  - "Hypothermia (<96°F)"
  - "Syncope"
  - "QTc prolongation, arrhythmias"
  - "Severe electrolyte abnormalities"
  - "Suicidal ideation"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Vital signs don't lie: HR <50, BP <80/50, orthostatic changes = ADMIT"
  - "ARFID: Avoidant/restrictive eating WITHOUT body image disturbance"
  - "Family-Based Treatment (FBT/Maudsley): First-line for adolescent anorexia"
  - "Refeeding syndrome: Monitor phosphorus closely when refeeding"
  - "Normal weight doesn't rule out eating disorder - look at trajectory"

key_history_questions:
  - "Eating habits? Restricting? Binging? Purging?"
  - "Weight history? Highest/lowest weight?"
  - "Exercise habits? Compulsive?"
  - "Body image concerns?"
  - "Menstrual history (females)?"
  - "Laxative, diet pill, or diuretic use?"
  - "Mood symptoms? Anxiety?"
  - "Family meals? Who prepares food?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Vital signs with orthostatics"
  - "BMI and growth trajectory"
  - "Bradycardia, hypothermia"
  - "Lanugo hair, dry skin"
  - "Parotid enlargement, dental erosions (purging)"
  - "Russell's sign (knuckle calluses from purging)"
  - "Hair loss, brittle nails"

treatment_principles:
  - "Medical stabilization first if unstable"
  - "Adolescent AN: Family-Based Treatment (FBT) first-line"
  - "Nutritional rehabilitation with dietitian"
  - "Treat comorbidities (depression, anxiety, OCD)"
  - "Refeeding: Start low, advance slowly, monitor phosphorus"
  - "Team approach: Medical, therapy, nutrition"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit: HR <50, BP <80/50, orthostatic, temp <96°F, severe electrolytes, suicidal"
  - "Specialized eating disorder program: Ideal for severe cases"
  - "Outpatient: Medically stable with engaged family"
  - "Intensive outpatient or partial hospital: Moderate severity"
  - "Frequent monitoring: Weekly weights, vital signs initially"

parent_styles: [terrified, controlling-food, in-denial, guilt-ridden]
