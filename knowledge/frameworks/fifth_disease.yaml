# Fifth Disease - Teaching Framework
topic: "Erythema Infectiosum"
aliases: ["fifth disease", "slapped cheek disease", "parvovirus B19"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [24, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic slapped cheek and lacy rash"
  - "Understand timing: no longer contagious when rash appears"
  - "Know high-risk groups: pregnant women, hemoglobinopathies"
  - "Differentiate from other viral exanthems"
  - "Counsel on benign course in healthy children"

common_mistakes:
  - "Excluding from school/daycare when rash present"
  - "Missing risk to pregnant contacts"
  - "Not asking about hemoglobinopathy history"
  - "Treating with unnecessary antibiotics"
  - "Confusing with allergic reaction"

red_flags:
  - "Known hemoglobinopathy (sickle cell - aplastic crisis risk)"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"
  - "Pregnant contact (especially first trimester)"
  - "Severe anemia symptoms"
  - "Arthritis/arthralgia (more common in adults)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic 3-stage rash: slapped cheeks -> lacy/reticular on extremities -> recurrent with triggers"
  - "By time rash appears, child is no longer contagious"
  - "Rash may recur for weeks with sun, heat, bathing, stress"
  - "Low-grade or no fever when rash appears"
  - "Most contagious 5-14 days before rash (during prodrome)"
  - "Can cause aplastic crisis in sickle cell disease"
  - "Hydrops fetalis risk if maternal infection in pregnancy"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did rash start?"
  - "Pattern of rash: face first?"
  - "Any prodromal illness before rash?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Does rash come and go?"
  - "Any pregnant women in household or close contacts?"
  - "History of sickle cell or other blood disorders?"
  - "Sick contacts or school outbreak?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Bright red cheeks (slapped cheek appearance)"
  - "Circumoral pallor"
  - "Lacy, reticular rash on trunk and extremities"
  - "Rash blanches"
  - "May have mild joint swelling (older children/teens)"
  - "Generally well-appearing"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care only in healthy children"
  - "Antipyretics/analgesics for joint pain if needed"
  - "Rash is self-limited, no treatment needed"
  - "Counsel about recurrent rash with triggers"
  - "No isolation needed once rash appears"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All healthy children"
  - "Hematology alert: Child with sickle cell or hemoglobinopathy"
  - "School/daycare: Can attend with rash (not contagious at that point)"
  - "Pregnant contact: Advise to notify OB for serology testing"
  - "Follow-up: Not routinely needed"

parent_styles: [school-policy-focused, worried-about-pregnant-contact, reassurance-seeking]
