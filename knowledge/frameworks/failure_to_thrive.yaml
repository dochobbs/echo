# Failure to Thrive (FTT) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Failure to Thrive"
aliases: ["FTT", "poor weight gain", "growth failure"]
category: newborn
age_range_months: [0, 36]

teaching_goals:
  - "Apply correct definition of FTT"
  - "Recognize non-organic (social/caloric) as most common cause"
  - "Use history as primary diagnostic tool"
  - "Know when to worry about refeeding syndrome"

common_mistakes:
  - "Ordering shotgun labs before thorough diet history"
  - "Assuming organic cause without adequate social assessment"
  - "Missing non-organic causes (inadequate intake, improper mixing)"
  - "Initiating rapid refeeding in severely malnourished infant"

red_flags:
  - "Severe malnutrition requiring hospitalization"
  - "Signs of neglect or abuse"
  - "Developmental regression"
  - "Dysmorphic features suggesting syndrome"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Definition: Weight crossing 2 major percentiles downward OR weight <5th percentile"
  - ">90% is Non-Organic (social/caloric insufficiency), not medical"
  - "History is the MOST IMPORTANT diagnostic tool - detailed diet history"
  - "Shotgun labs are LOW YIELD - start with CBC, Lead, UA"
  - "Severe malnutrition: Monitor Phos/K/Mag for refeeding syndrome"

key_history_questions:
  - "What does the child eat in a typical day? (detailed 24-hour recall)"
  - "How is formula mixed? (show me)"
  - "Who feeds the child? How long do feeds take?"
  - "Any food insecurity or WIC issues?"
  - "Family stressors or changes?"
  - "Developmental milestones?"
  - "Vomiting, diarrhea, or other GI symptoms?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Accurate weight, length, head circumference"
  - "Plotting on growth chart - pattern over time"
  - "Signs of neglect"
  - "Dysmorphic features"
  - "Developmental assessment"
  - "Signs of organic disease"

treatment_principles:
  - "Increase caloric intake first"
  - "Close follow-up with weight checks"
  - "Social work involvement if indicated"
  - "Limited labs initially: CBC, Lead, UA"
  - "Hospitalization for severe cases or supervision of intake"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Mild FTT, engaged family, adequate resources"
  - "Close follow-up: Weekly weight checks initially"
  - "Hospitalization: Severe FTT, concern for neglect, need for supervised feeding"
  - "Social work: Food insecurity, family stressors"

parent_styles: [overwhelmed, defensive, engaged, food-insecure]
