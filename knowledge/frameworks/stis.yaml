topic: "Sexually Transmitted Infections"
aliases: ["STIs", "STDs", "chlamydia", "gonorrhea", "sexually transmitted"]
category: adolescent
age_range_months: [120, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Screen appropriately per guidelines"
  - "Know syndromic management approach"
  - "Treat empirically and expedited partner therapy"
  - "Maintain confidentiality"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not screening sexually active adolescents"
  - "Waiting for test results before treating symptomatic patients"
  - "Not offering expedited partner therapy"
  - "Breaching confidentiality"

red_flags:
  - "PID symptoms (fever, severe pelvic pain)"
  - "Signs of disseminated gonococcal infection"
  - "Possible sexual abuse in child or young adolescent"
  - "HIV seroconversion illness"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Screen: All sexually active adolescents for chlamydia/gonorrhea annually"
  - "High-risk: Screen more frequently (every 3-6 months)"
  - "Syndromic treatment: Treat BOTH chlamydia and gonorrhea if symptomatic urethritis/cervicitis"
  - "EPT (Expedited Partner Therapy): Give patient rx for partner - reduces reinfection"
  - "Confidentiality: Minors can consent to STI care in most states"

key_history_questions:
  - "Sexually active? Partners (number, gender)?"
  - "Condom use?"
  - "Previous STIs?"
  - "Symptoms: Discharge, dysuria, lesions, pelvic pain?"
  - "Last menstrual period?"
  - "Any new partners?"
  - "Any concerning relationship dynamics? (safety)"
  - "Obtain history CONFIDENTIALLY (without parent if possible)"

key_exam_findings:
  - "External genital exam: Lesions, discharge, warts"
  - "Urethral discharge"
  - "Cervical discharge, friability, motion tenderness (if pelvic exam)"
  - "Inguinal lymphadenopathy"
  - "Oral lesions"
  - "Skin (rash, palmar lesions in syphilis)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Chlamydia: Doxycycline 100mg BID x 7 days (or azithromycin 1g x 1 if compliance concern)"
  - "Gonorrhea: Ceftriaxone 500mg IM x 1"
  - "Treat both empirically if symptomatic urethritis/cervicitis"
  - "PID: Ceftriaxone + doxycycline +/- metronidazole"
  - "Expedited Partner Therapy: Provide prescriptions for partners"
  - "Test of cure: Not routine except in pregnancy or pharyngeal GC"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most STIs"
  - "Admit: Severe PID, tubo-ovarian abscess, disseminated infection"
  - "Testing: NAAT for chlamydia/gonorrhea (urine or swab), HIV, syphilis"
  - "Report: Gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV to public health (chlamydia varies)"
  - "Retest: 3 months after treatment for chlamydia/gonorrhea (reinfection common)"

parent_styles: [not-involved-confidential, involved-and-supportive, judgmental]
