# Pertussis (Whooping Cough) - Teaching Framework
topic: "Pertussis"
aliases: ["whooping cough", "100-day cough"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize age-specific presentations"
  - "Know treatment serves dual purpose (patient + contacts)"
  - "Understand prophylaxis requirements"
  - "Identify high-risk infants"

common_mistakes:
  - "Expecting 'whoop' in infants (they present with APNEA)"
  - "Not testing teens with prolonged cough"
  - "Forgetting prophylaxis for household contacts"
  - "Not recognizing mild presentation in vaccinated children"

red_flags:
  - "Apnea in young infant"
  - "Cyanosis with paroxysms"
  - "Post-tussive vomiting"
  - "Infant <6 months (high complication rate)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "INFANTS present with APNEA, not whoop"
  - "TEENS present with persistent cough >2 weeks"
  - "Azithromycin: Treats patient AND prevents spread"
  - "Prophylaxis: ALL household contacts regardless of vaccination status"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of cough?"
  - "Character - paroxysmal? Whooping sound?"
  - "Post-tussive vomiting?"
  - "Any apneic episodes?"
  - "Vaccination status?"
  - "Sick contacts?"
  - "Household member vaccination status?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Paroxysmal coughing"
  - "Post-tussive gagging or vomiting"
  - "Subconjunctival hemorrhage"
  - "Oxygen saturation (check during and after paroxysm)"
  - "Signs of respiratory distress"

treatment_principles:
  - "Azithromycin: 10 mg/kg day 1, then 5 mg/kg days 2-5"
  - "Alternative: TMP-SMX"
  - "Prophylaxis for all close contacts (same regimen)"
  - "Treatment doesn't shorten course but reduces transmission"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit: Infants <6 months, apnea, hypoxia, feeding difficulties"
  - "Outpatient: Older children without complications"
  - "Public health notification required"

parent_styles: [scared-about-infant, frustrated-with-cough-duration, needs-work-note]
