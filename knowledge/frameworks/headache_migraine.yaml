# Headache and Migraine - Teaching Framework
topic: "Headache and Migraine"
aliases: ["headache", "migraine", "tension headache", "pediatric headache"]
category: neuro
age_range_months: [36, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish primary from secondary headaches"
  - "Recognize migraine criteria in children"
  - "Know when imaging is NOT indicated"
  - "Understand medication overuse headache"

common_mistakes:
  - "Imaging for typical migraine (low yield)"
  - "Not screening for medication overuse"
  - "Missing abdominal migraine"
  - "Not addressing lifestyle factors (sleep, hydration, screens)"

red_flags:
  - "Worst headache of life (sudden, severe)"
  - "Headache with neurologic signs (papilledema, focal deficits)"
  - "Headache worse with Valsalva, position change, or waking from sleep"
  - "New headache pattern, progressive worsening"
  - "Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, meningismus)"
  - "Age <6 with new headaches"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Migraine in kids: SHORTER duration (1-72h vs 4-72h adults), bilateral ok, GI symptoms prominent"
  - "No imaging for typical migraine with normal neuro exam"
  - "Medication overuse: >2-3 days/week acute medications → rebound headaches"
  - "Abdominal migraine: Recurrent midline abdominal pain with migraine features"
  - "Lifestyle: Sleep, hydration, meals, exercise, screen limits - address FIRST"

key_history_questions:
  - "Location? Quality? Severity?"
  - "Duration? Frequency?"
  - "Triggers? Relieving factors?"
  - "Associated symptoms (nausea, light/sound sensitivity, aura)?"
  - "How many days/week taking pain medication?"
  - "Sleep habits? Hydration? Meals?"
  - "Screen time? Caffeine?"
  - "Family history of migraines?"
  - "School absences? Impact on activities?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Vital signs including blood pressure"
  - "Complete neurologic exam"
  - "Fundoscopy (papilledema)"
  - "Head circumference (if progressive)"
  - "Palpate sinuses, TMJ, neck muscles"
  - "Red flags should be ABSENT for primary headache"

treatment_principles:
  - "Lifestyle optimization: Sleep, hydration, meals, exercise, screen limits"
  - "Acute migraine: Ibuprofen EARLY (within 30 min of onset), triptan if >12"
  - "Limit acute medications to <2-3 days/week to prevent overuse"
  - "Prophylaxis if frequent (>1/week): Topiramate, amitriptyline, propranolol"
  - "Keep headache diary"
  - "Behavioral: Biofeedback, relaxation, CBT"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Typical primary headache"
  - "Urgent imaging: Any red flag features"
  - "Neurology referral: Refractory, atypical, diagnostic uncertainty"
  - "Follow-up with headache diary in 4-6 weeks"
