# Cryptorchidism - Teaching Framework
topic: "Cryptorchidism"
aliases: ["undescended testicle", "undescended testis", "cryptorchidism"]
category: urology
age_range_months: [0, 24]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish true undescended from retractile testis"
  - "Know referral timing (by 6 months of age)"
  - "Understand risks of untreated cryptorchidism"
  - "Recognize nonpalpable testis requires imaging/exploration"

common_mistakes:
  - "Waiting too long to refer (surgery by 6-12 months ideal)"
  - "Confusing retractile testis with undescended (retractile can be milked into scrotum)"
  - "Not checking for bilateral absence (ambiguous genitalia workup)"
  - "Ordering imaging before surgical referral"

red_flags:
  - "Bilateral nonpalpable testes (DSD workup)"
  - "Inguinal hernia symptoms with undescended testis"
  - "Unilateral undescended with contralateral abnormality"
  - "Any testicular torsion symptoms"

clinical_pearls:
  - "3% of term, 30% of preterm newborns have UDT - most descend by 3-6 months"
  - "Retractile testis: Can be milked into scrotum and stays briefly - NO surgery needed"
  - "Undescended: Cannot be brought into scrotum - needs orchiopexy"
  - "Surgery: Ideal timing 6-12 months (latest by 18 months)"
  - "Risks of untreated: Infertility, increased testicular cancer risk"

key_history_questions:
  - "Was testis ever in scrotum? (May have been documented at birth)"
  - "Any painful episodes? (Torsion concern)"
  - "Any swelling in groin? (Hernia)"
  - "Family history of undescended testicle?"
  - "Premature birth?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Examine in warm room, patient relaxed"
  - "Start at inguinal canal, milk toward scrotum"
  - "Can testis be brought into scrotum? Does it stay?"
  - "If in canal: Palpable vs nonpalpable"
  - "Contralateral testis exam"
  - "Signs of hernia"
  - "If bilateral nonpalpable: Evaluate for ambiguous genitalia"

treatment_principles:
  - "Observation: If preterm or <3 months - most descend spontaneously"
  - "Referral: By 6 months if still undescended"
  - "Surgery (orchiopexy): 6-12 months, latest by 18 months"
  - "Nonpalpable: Laparoscopy to locate and bring down or remove"
  - "Retractile testis: Observation, annual exams (risk of ascending testis)"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Refer to urology: By 6 months if testis remains undescended"
  - "Surgery: By 6-12 months ideally"
  - "No imaging needed for palpable undescended - surgery will locate"
  - "Imaging/hormonal workup: Bilateral nonpalpable (karyotype, hormones)"
  - "Long-term: Annual testis exams, cancer awareness in adolescence"
