# Poison Ivy/Oak/Sumac - Teaching Framework
topic: "Toxicodendron Dermatitis"
aliases: ["poison ivy", "poison oak", "poison sumac", "rhus dermatitis"]
category: dermatology
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic linear vesicular rash"
  - "Understand that spreading is from ongoing exposure, not fluid"
  - "Know when systemic steroids are indicated"
  - "Counsel on prevention and decontamination"
  - "Manage severe or widespread cases"

common_mistakes:
  - "Thinking fluid spreads the rash (it doesn't)"
  - "Using short steroid courses that cause rebound"
  - "Under-treating severe cases"
  - "Missing secondary bacterial infection"
  - "Not counseling on decontamination of objects"

red_flags:
  - "Facial involvement, especially periorbital"
  - "Genital involvement"
  - "Widespread (> 10-20% BSA)"
  - "Secondary bacterial infection (honey crusting, spreading redness)"
  - "Difficulty breathing (smoke inhalation from burning plants)"
  - "Significant swelling"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Linear or streaky vesicular rash is classic"
  - "Delayed hypersensitivity: appears 24-72h after exposure"
  - "New lesions can appear over 2-3 weeks (areas with less oil, thicker skin)"
  - "Blister fluid is NOT contagious"
  - "Urushiol (oil) can persist on objects for months/years"
  - "20-30% of population not sensitive"
  - "Barrier creams before exposure may help prevent"
  - "Wash skin within 30 min of exposure can prevent reaction"

key_history_questions:
  - "Outdoor activity in past 1-3 days?"
  - "Contact with plants, pets, or objects from outside?"
  - "When did rash start?"
  - "Is it spreading?"
  - "Itching severity?"
  - "Previous poison ivy reactions?"
  - "Location of rash?"
  - "Any signs of infection?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Linear or streaky distribution"
  - "Vesicles, sometimes bullae"
  - "Erythema and edema"
  - "Crusting in older lesions"
  - "Distribution reflects exposure (lines of contact)"
  - "Secondary impetiginization"
  - "Periorbital or genital involvement"

treatment_principles:
  - "Mild/localized: high-potency topical steroid, cool compresses"
  - "Moderate-severe: systemic steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg)"
  - "Steroid taper: 14-21 days minimum (short courses cause rebound)"
  - "Antihistamines for itch (limited efficacy)"
  - "Calamine lotion, cool baths for comfort"
  - "Secondary infection: oral antibiotics"
  - "Decontaminate clothing, shoes, tools"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Systemic steroids if: Face, genitals, widespread, severe itch"
  - "Antibiotic: If secondary impetiginization"
  - "Return: Signs of infection, not improving, worsening"
  - "Prevention counseling: Learn to identify plants, wear protective clothing"
