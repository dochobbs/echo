  - "Recognize the allergic salute, shiners, and nasal crease"
  - "Understand stepwise treatment approach"
  - "Know when to refer for allergy testing"
  - "Recognize comorbidities (asthma, eczema, sinusitis)"

common_mistakes:
  - "Overtreating with oral decongestants in young children"

red_flags:
  - "Unilateral symptoms (foreign body, tumor)"
  - "Bloody discharge without trauma"
  - "Anosmia"
  - "Severe nasal obstruction affecting sleep/growth"
  - "Recurrent sinusitis"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Allergic shiners: dark circles from venous congestion"
  - "Allergic salute: upward nose rubbing causing nasal crease"
  - "Pale, boggy turbinates classic for allergic rhinitis"
  - "Intranasal steroids more effective than antihistamines for congestion"
  - "Start nasal steroids 2 weeks before allergy season"
  - "Strong association with atopic triad: rhinitis, asthma, eczema"

key_history_questions:
  - "Seasonal vs year-round symptoms?"
  - "Sneezing, itching, congestion, rhinorrhea?"
  - "Eye symptoms?"
  - "Triggers identified?"
  - "Family history of atopy?"
  - "Mouth breathing or snoring?"
  - "Impact on sleep and school?"
  - "Previous treatments tried?"

key_exam_findings:

  - "Nasal crease"
  - "Allergic shiners"
  - "Conjunctival injection"
  - "Tonsil size"
  - "Mouth breathing"
  - "Listen for wheeze (asthma)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Allergen avoidance when possible"
  - "First-line: intranasal corticosteroids"
  - "Add oral second-generation antihistamine for itching/sneezing"
  - "Nasal saline irrigation helpful adjunct"
  - "Avoid oral decongestants in young children"
  - "Consider immunotherapy for severe, refractory cases"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Allergy referral: Severe symptoms, failed empiric treatment, considering immunotherapy"
  - "ENT referral: Structural concerns, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis"
  - "Pulmonology: Concurrent uncontrolled asthma"
