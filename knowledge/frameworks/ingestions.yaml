# Poisoning and Ingestions - Teaching Framework
topic: "Poisoning and Ingestions"
aliases: ["poisoning", "ingestion", "overdose", "toxic ingestion"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know which ingestions require immediate intervention"
  - "Call Poison Control for guidance"
  - "Recognize toxidromes"
  - "Know decontamination is rarely indicated"

common_mistakes:
  - "Inducing vomiting (no longer recommended)"
  - "Giving activated charcoal for all ingestions"
  - "Not calling Poison Control"
  - "Missing button battery (emergency!)"
  - "Underestimating 'one pill can kill' medications"

red_flags:
  - "Button battery ingestion (emergency if esophageal)"
  - "One pill can kill: CCBs, opioids, sulfonylureas, TCAs, clonidine"
  - "Altered mental status"
  - "Cardiac arrhythmias"
  - "Symptomatic ingestion"
  - "Intentional/suicidal ingestion"

clinical_pearls:
  - "CALL POISON CONTROL: 1-800-222-1222 - always call for guidance"
  - "Button battery in esophagus: EMERGENCY - can cause perforation in 2 hours"
  - "Activated charcoal: Only within 1-2 hours, contraindicated in caustic/hydrocarbon"
  - "Do NOT induce vomiting - ineffective and potentially harmful"
  - "Toxidromes: Anticholinergic, cholinergic, sympathomimetic, opioid, sedative-hypnotic"

key_history_questions:
  - "What was ingested? Exact product name?"
  - "How much? Maximum possible amount?"
  - "When was exposure?"
  - "Intentional or accidental?"
  - "Any symptoms?"
  - "Any co-ingestions?"
  - "Child's weight?"
  - "Any treatments given at home?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Vital signs - HR, BP, RR, temp, O2 sat"
  - "Mental status - GCS"
  - "Pupils - miosis (opioids) vs mydriasis (anticholinergic)"
  - "Skin - diaphoresis, dry, flushed"
  - "Cardiac - rhythm, rate"
  - "Bowel sounds - hyper vs hypo"
  - "Identify toxidrome"

treatment_principles:
  - "ABCs - stabilize first"
  - "Call Poison Control for specific guidance"
  - "Decontamination: Rarely indicated; activated charcoal if <1-2 hours and appropriate"
  - "Antidotes: Specific to toxin (naloxone, N-acetylcysteine, etc.)"
  - "Supportive care for most ingestions"
  - "ECG for cardiotoxic medications"
  - "Psych evaluation if intentional"

disposition_guidance:
  - "ED: Any symptomatic ingestion, high-risk medication, button battery"
  - "Observation: Poison Control will guide duration"
  - "Admit: Symptomatic, requiring monitoring or treatment"
  - "Psych: Intentional ingestion requires mental health evaluation"
  - "Home: If Poison Control clears (many pediatric ingestions are non-toxic)"
