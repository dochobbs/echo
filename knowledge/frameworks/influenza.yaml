# Influenza - Teaching Framework
topic: "Influenza"
aliases: ["flu", "influenza-like illness"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know when antiviral treatment is indicated"
  - "Identify high-risk groups requiring prompt treatment"
  - "Understand vaccine schedule for children"
  - "Recognize complications requiring admission"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not treating high-risk children because >48 hours from onset"
  - "Forgetting 2-dose series for children <9 years first time"
  - "Missing complications (secondary bacterial pneumonia)"
  - "Over-testing in classic presentation during flu season"

red_flags:
  - "Respiratory distress"
  - "Altered mental status"
  - "Dehydration"
  - "Secondary bacterial infection signs"
  - "High-risk group with severe symptoms"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Oseltamivir works best if started <48h, but still indicated >48h for severe/hospitalized"
  - "High-risk: Children <2y, asthma, neuro/metabolic conditions - treat promptly"
  - "Children <9y receiving FIRST flu vaccine need 2 doses separated by 4 weeks"
  - "During flu season, clinical diagnosis often sufficient"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of symptoms?"
  - "Fever, cough, body aches?"
  - "Sick contacts with confirmed flu?"
  - "Underlying conditions (asthma, diabetes, neuromuscular)?"
  - "Vaccination status?"
  - "Able to eat and drink?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Temperature"
  - "Respiratory exam (rate, effort, sounds)"
  - "Hydration status"
  - "Mental status"
  - "Signs of secondary infection (focal lung findings)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Oseltamivir: <48h ideal, but use >48h if severe or high-risk"
  - "Supportive care: Hydration, antipyretics"
  - "High-risk patients: Lower threshold for treatment"
  - "Prophylaxis for high-risk exposed contacts"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Uncomplicated flu in healthy child"
  - "Close follow-up: High-risk patients"
  - "Admit: Respiratory distress, dehydration, altered mental status"

seasonality:
  peak_months: [12, 1, 2, 3]
  pattern: "Winter epidemic"

parent_styles: [wants-Tamiflu, vaccine-hesitant, worried-about-complications]
