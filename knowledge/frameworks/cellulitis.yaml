# Cellulitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Cellulitis"
aliases: ["skin infection", "erysipelas"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish cellulitis from abscess"
  - "Choose appropriate antibiotic coverage"
  - "Recognize when IV antibiotics needed"
  - "Identify high-risk locations and complications"
  - "Know when to image and when to refer"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing underlying abscess"
  - "Not marking borders to track progression"
  - "Inadequate MRSA coverage in appropriate populations"
  - "Treating insect bite reaction as cellulitis"
  - "Missing periorbital vs orbital cellulitis distinction"

red_flags:
  - "Orbital cellulitis (proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, vision change)"
  - "Rapidly spreading despite antibiotics"
  - "Crepitus (necrotizing fasciitis)"
  - "Pain out of proportion to exam"
  - "Signs of sepsis"
  - "Periorbital in young child (bacteremia risk)"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Cellulitis: spreading erythema, warmth, without clear fluid collection"
  - "Erysipelas: sharply demarcated, raised borders (superficial)"
  - "Mark borders with pen to track progression"
  - "Beta-hemolytic strep and S. aureus most common"
  - "Purulent cellulitis: add MRSA coverage"
  - "Non-purulent cellulitis: beta-lactam usually adequate"
  - "Periorbital vs orbital: EOM, proptosis, vision = orbital (CT needed)"
  - "Improvement takes 48-72 hours - don't change antibiotics too soon"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did it start?"
  - "Getting better or worse?"
  - "Any drainage or pus?"
  - "Fever?"
  - "Recent wound, bite, or break in skin?"
  - "Diabetes or immune problems?"
  - "Previous skin infections or MRSA?"
  - "Recent antibiotics?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Erythema borders - mark with pen"
  - "Warmth and tenderness"
  - "Fluctuance (suggests abscess)"
  - "Lymphangitic streaking"
  - "Regional lymphadenopathy"
  - "Crepitus (concerning for necrotizing)"
  - "Fever"
  - "If face: eye exam - EOM, proptosis, vision"

treatment_principles:
  - "Non-purulent: cephalexin or dicloxacillin (cover strep and MSSA)"
  - "Purulent/MRSA risk: TMP-SMX or doxycycline + cephalexin"
  - "Mark borders and recheck in 24-48 hours"
  - "Elevation of affected extremity"
  - "Treat underlying wound or entry point"
  - "Duration: 5-7 days (can extend if slow response)"
  - "IV antibiotics: failed oral, rapid spread, systemic illness"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Localized cellulitis, non-toxic, reliable follow-up"
  - "24-hour recheck: To ensure improvement"
  - "ED/admission: Orbital cellulitis, rapid spread, sepsis, facial cellulitis in infant"
  - "Imaging (CT): Periorbital not improving, any orbital symptoms"
  - "Return: Spreading despite antibiotics, fever, worsening pain"

parent_styles: [anxious, MRSA-concerned, antibiotic-seeking]
