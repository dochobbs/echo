# Alopecia - Teaching Framework
topic: "Alopecia"
aliases: ["hair loss", "alopecia areata", "telogen effluvium"]
category: derm
age_range_months: [12, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Differentiate alopecia areata from tinea capitis"
  - "Recognize traction alopecia patterns"
  - "Know telogen effluvium is usually self-limited"
  - "Identify when evaluation for systemic disease is needed"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating alopecia areata with antifungals (it's autoimmune)"
  - "Missing tinea capitis (do KOH/culture)"
  - "Not asking about hair care practices (traction alopecia)"
  - "Over-investigating self-limited telogen effluvium"

red_flags:
  - "Signs of systemic illness (thyroid, lupus, iron deficiency)"
  - "Scarring alopecia (permanent)"
  - "Trichotillomania with other self-harm behaviors"
  - "Rapid progression or total hair loss"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Alopecia areata: Smooth, round patches WITHOUT scale - 'exclamation point' hairs at border"
  - "Tinea capitis: Scaling, broken hairs, may have lymphadenopathy"
  - "Telogen effluvium: Diffuse shedding 2-3 months after stressor (illness, surgery, childbirth)"
  - "Traction alopecia: Frontal/temporal hairline recession from tight hairstyles"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did hair loss start? Sudden or gradual?"
  - "Any recent illness, surgery, or stress?"
  - "Family history of autoimmune diseases?"
  - "Hair care practices? Tight hairstyles?"
  - "Any pulling or twisting of hair?"
  - "Other symptoms (fatigue, weight changes)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Pattern of hair loss (patchy vs diffuse)"
  - "Scalp appearance (scaling, erythema, scarring)"
  - "Hair pull test (positive in telogen effluvium)"
  - "Exclamation point hairs (alopecia areata)"
  - "Check for nail pitting (associated with alopecia areata)"
  - "Thyroid exam, signs of systemic disease"

treatment_principles:
  - "Alopecia areata: Often regrows spontaneously; topical steroids, minoxidil"
  - "Telogen effluvium: Reassurance - regrows in 3-6 months"
  - "Traction alopecia: Stop offending hairstyle - may be permanent if chronic"
  - "Tinea capitis: Oral antifungal (see tinea framework)"
  - "Trichotillomania: Behavioral therapy referral"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "Dermatology referral: Alopecia areata, scarring alopecia, uncertain diagnosis"
  - "Workup if indicated: TSH, CBC, ferritin, ANA"
  - "Psychology/psychiatry: Trichotillomania"

parent_styles: [concerned-about-appearance, wants-testing, anxious]
