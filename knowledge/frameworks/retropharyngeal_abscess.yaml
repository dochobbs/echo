# Retropharyngeal Abscess - Teaching Framework
topic: "Retropharyngeal Abscess"
aliases: ["RPA", "deep neck space infection", "retropharyngeal infection"]
category: ENT
age_range_months: [6, 60]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize clinical presentation"
  - "Distinguish from other causes of neck stiffness"
  - "Know imaging approach"
  - "Understand airway risk"
  - "Know when surgery is needed"

common_mistakes:
  - "Missing in child with neck stiffness and fever"
  - "Assuming meningitis without considering deep neck infection"
  - "Delaying CT imaging"
  - "Not involving ENT early"
  - "Inadequate antibiotic coverage"

red_flags:
  - "Stridor or respiratory distress"
  - "Drooling, inability to swallow"
  - "Torticollis with fever"
  - "Rapidly progressive symptoms"
  - "Mediastinal extension"
  - "Sepsis"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Peak age: < 4 years (retropharyngeal nodes involute by age 5)"
  - "Often follows URI or pharyngitis"
  - "Classic triad: fever, neck stiffness/torticollis, pharyngeal swelling"
  - "Neck extended (not flexed like meningitis)"
  - "Refusal to swallow, drooling"
  - "CT with contrast is diagnostic"
  - "Retropharyngeal space can extend to mediastinum"
  - "Phlegmon vs abscess - affects treatment (medical vs surgical)"

key_history_questions:
  - "Fever duration and height?"
  - "Sore throat or difficulty swallowing?"
  - "Neck stiffness or head position?"
  - "Drooling?"
  - "Recent URI or pharyngitis?"
  - "Breathing difficulty?"
  - "Trauma or foreign body?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Fever (often high)"
  - "Neck stiffness with extension (not flexion)"
  - "Torticollis"
  - "Drooling, difficulty swallowing"
  - "Muffled voice"
  - "Pharyngeal bulge (may be subtle)"
  - "Cervical lymphadenopathy"
  - "Stridor (concerning)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Airway management is priority"
  - "NPO, IV access"
  - "CT neck with contrast for diagnosis"
  - "IV antibiotics: ampicillin-sulbactam or clindamycin"
  - "Cover: strep, staph (including MRSA), anaerobes"
  - "Phlegmon/small abscess: IV antibiotics, may not need drainage"
  - "Large abscess: surgical drainage (transoral or external)"
  - "ENT consultation essential"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Admit all: Need IV antibiotics and close monitoring"
  - "ICU: Airway compromise, sepsis"
  - "CT with contrast: Confirm diagnosis, assess extent"
  - "ENT: All patients for evaluation"
  - "Serial exams: Monitor for clinical improvement"
  - "Repeat imaging: If not improving clinically"
