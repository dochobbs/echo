screening_tools:
  - tool: "M-CHAT-R/F (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up)"
    when: "routine"
    notes: "Routine screening at 18 and 24 months per AAP. Positive screen requires follow-up interview (M-CHAT-R/F). Medium-risk (score 3-7) requires follow-up; high-risk (score 8-20) warrants immediate referral."
  - tool: "Blood lead level"
    when: "risk-based (required for Medicaid at 12 and 24 months)"
    notes: "Universal screening for Medicaid-enrolled children. Risk-based for others: older housing (pre-1978), renovation exposure, immigrant/refugee, pica behavior, sibling with elevated lead."
  - tool: "ASQ-3 (Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd Ed)"
    when: "if concern; routine at 30 months"
    notes: "Upcoming at 30-month visit. Use at 24 months if developmental concern raised by parent or clinical observation."
  - tool: "BMI-for-age percentile (CDC growth charts)"
    when: "routine (begins at 24 months)"
    notes: "Transition from WHO weight-for-length to CDC BMI-for-age at 2 years. Overweight: 85th-94th percentile. Obesity: >= 95th percentile."
  - tool: "Dental screening and fluoride varnish"
    when: "routine"
    notes: "Apply fluoride varnish if teeth present. Confirm establishment of dental home (first visit by age 1 or within 6 months of first tooth)."

anticipatory_guidance:
  safety:
    - "Car seat: Remain rear-facing as long as possible (until maximum height or weight allowed by car seat manufacturer); most children should remain rear-facing until at least age 2"
    - "Drowning prevention: Never leave unattended near water -- bathtubs, pools, buckets. Fence pools with self-closing, self-latching gates. Constant arm's-reach supervision"
    - "Poison prevention: Lock up medications and household chemicals. Keep Poison Control number accessible (1-800-222-1222). No syrup of ipecac"
    - "Gun safety: If firearms in the home, store locked, unloaded, ammunition separate. Ask about firearms in homes where child visits"
    - "Fall prevention: Use window guards above first floor. Gate stairways. Supervise playground equipment"
    - "Pedestrian safety: Hold hands near streets and in parking lots. Toddlers have no traffic sense"
    - "Choking hazards: Avoid round, hard foods (whole grapes, hot dogs, nuts, popcorn, raw carrots). Cut food into small pieces. Supervise eating"
  nutrition:
    - "Transition to low-fat (1%) or skim milk after age 2 (whole milk recommended from 12-24 months for brain development)"
    - "Limit milk intake to 16-24 oz per day to prevent iron deficiency anemia (milk displaces iron-rich foods and inhibits iron absorption)"
    - "Offer a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein at each meal. Allow self-feeding"
    - "Avoid juice or limit to 4 oz/day of 100% fruit juice. Water is the preferred beverage after milk"
    - "Expect picky eating and food jags as normal toddler behavior. Avoid using food as reward or punishment"
    - "Division of responsibility (Ellyn Satter): Parent decides what, when, and where to eat; child decides whether and how much"
    - "Ensure adequate iron and vitamin D intake. Consider iron-rich foods (meat, beans, fortified cereals) and vitamin D supplementation if dietary intake inadequate"
  development:
    - "Read together daily -- at least 15-20 minutes. Let child turn pages, point to pictures, and fill in words in familiar stories"
    - "Encourage pretend play, which supports cognitive and social development"
    - "Talk throughout the day, narrating activities ('Now we're putting on your shoes'). Expand on child's 2-word phrases ('Yes, the big red truck!')"
    - "Provide opportunities for physical play -- running, climbing, kicking balls, playground time"
    - "Limit screen time to no more than 1 hour per day of high-quality programming (AAP). Co-view and discuss content. Avoid screens during meals and before bedtime"
    - "Discuss preschool readiness and the benefits of group learning environments for socialization and language development"
  behavior:
    - "Expect tantrums as normal at this age -- toddlers have big emotions and limited language to express them"
    - "Use positive reinforcement and praise for desired behaviors rather than focusing on punishment"
    - "Offer limited choices to foster autonomy ('Do you want the red cup or the blue cup?')"
    - "Set consistent, age-appropriate limits and follow through calmly"
    - "Redirect rather than punish. Time-outs are appropriate only briefly (1 minute per year of age) and in a safe, boring location"
    - "Normal to have separation anxiety that may intensify with transitions (new daycare, new sibling)"
    - "Discuss biting, hitting, and aggressive behavior as developmentally typical but requiring consistent redirection"
  sleep:
    - "Total sleep: approximately 11-14 hours per 24-hour period (including one nap)"
    - "Most toddlers transition from 2 naps to 1 nap between 12-18 months; by 24 months, expect a single afternoon nap of 1-3 hours"
    - "Maintain consistent bedtime routine: bath, teeth brushing, books, lights out at a regular time"
    - "Transition from crib to toddler bed when child climbs out of crib or reaches 35 inches tall. Use bed rails for safety"
    - "Night waking may return with developmental leaps, illness, or schedule changes. Respond consistently"
    - "Avoid screens for at least 1 hour before bedtime"
  toilet_training:
    - "Assess readiness signs: staying dry for 2+ hours, showing interest in the toilet, discomfort with dirty diapers, able to follow simple instructions, can pull pants up and down"
    - "Do not pressure or punish -- readiness varies widely (most children train between 18-36 months)"
    - "Introduce a potty chair and let the child sit on it fully clothed initially to build familiarity"
    - "Praise attempts, not just success. Avoid showing disappointment with accidents"
    - "Most children achieve daytime dryness before nighttime dryness. Nighttime enuresis is normal until age 5-7"

immunizations_due:
  - vaccine: "Hepatitis A (HepA)"
    cvx: 83
    dose_number: "2nd dose (catch-up)"
    notes: "Minimum interval 6 months from 1st dose (1st dose given at 12 months). Inactivated vaccine, intramuscular. Completes the 2-dose series."
  - vaccine: "Influenza (IIV or LAIV)"
    cvx: 150
    dose_number: "Annual dose"
    notes: "Annual influenza vaccination recommended for all children 6 months and older. If first-ever influenza vaccination, child needs 2 doses separated by at least 4 weeks. LAIV (nasal spray, CVX 151) approved for age 2+ without contraindications."

physical_exam_focus:
  - area: "Growth parameters -- transition to CDC charts"
    detail: "Plot weight, height (standing), and head circumference. Calculate BMI (weight in kg / height in meters squared). Plot BMI-for-age on CDC growth charts. Transition from WHO charts (used for 0-24 months) to CDC charts (used for 2-20 years)."
    teaching_point: "This visit marks a critical transition: WHO growth charts are used from birth to 24 months because they describe how children SHOULD grow (breastfed reference). CDC charts are used from age 2 to 20 and describe how US children DO grow. BMI-for-age begins at age 2 -- overweight is 85th-94th percentile, obesity is >= 95th percentile. Standing height replaces recumbent length, which may measure 1-2 cm shorter."
  - area: "Language and communication assessment"
    detail: "Assess expressive vocabulary (expect 50+ words), use of 2-word phrases, ability to follow 2-step commands, and pointing to body parts. Observe quality of communication -- does the child initiate communication, respond to name, use gestures?"
    teaching_point: "Language delay is the most common developmental concern identified at 24 months. Fewer than 50 words or no 2-word combinations by 24 months warrants referral to speech-language pathology and audiology. Late talkers who have good receptive language and gestures have better prognosis, but all should be referred -- do not adopt a 'wait and see' approach."
  - area: "Behavioral and social-emotional assessment"
    detail: "Observe child's interaction with caregiver and examiner. Note eye contact, joint attention, pretend play, response to name, pointing, and social reciprocity. Review M-CHAT-R/F results."
    teaching_point: "The 24-month visit is a critical window for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection. Red flags include: no 2-word phrases, loss of previously acquired skills (regression), poor eye contact, lack of pretend play, no pointing to show interest, not responding to name. A positive M-CHAT-R/F should trigger both developmental referral AND Early Intervention services simultaneously -- do not wait for specialist evaluation to begin services."
  - area: "Dental examination"
    detail: "Count teeth (expect 16-20 primary teeth by 24 months). Inspect for caries (brown or white spots on enamel, especially upper incisors), gum health, malocclusion, and oral trauma."
    teaching_point: "Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Major risk factors: bottle/sippy cup with milk or juice at bedtime, frequent sugary snacks, no fluoride exposure, no dental home. Counsel on brushing twice daily with a rice-grain-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste and establishing a dental home if not already done."
  - area: "Gait and musculoskeletal assessment"
    detail: "Observe the child walking and running. Assess for genu varum (bowlegs) which is physiologic at this age, toe-walking, asymmetric gait, and in-toeing."
    teaching_point: "Physiologic genu varum (bowlegs) is maximal around 12-18 months and should be improving by 24 months. Red flags for pathologic bowing: asymmetric, progressive worsening after 18 months, lateral thrust during walking, or short stature (consider Blount disease or rickets). Most in-toeing at this age is from metatarsus adductus or internal tibial torsion and is self-correcting."
  - area: "Skin"
    detail: "Examine for eczema (atopic dermatitis), bruising patterns, birthmarks, and infectious lesions. Note distribution and symmetry of any bruising."
    teaching_point: "Bruising in a toddler who is walking and running is common over bony prominences (shins, forehead, knees). Bruising in non-mobile areas (ears, neck, trunk, buttocks) or in a specific pattern should raise concern for non-accidental trauma. Document bruise location, size, and pattern carefully."
  - area: "Abdomen"
    detail: "Palpate for hepatosplenomegaly, masses, and tenderness. Inspect for umbilical hernia."
    teaching_point: "Umbilical hernias are common in toddlers and most close spontaneously by age 4-5. Referral for surgical repair if hernia persists beyond age 4-5, is larger than 2 cm, is incarcerated, or is symptomatic. Do not recommend home remedies (taping, coin placement)."

common_mistakes:
  - "Continuing to use WHO growth charts after age 2 instead of transitioning to CDC growth charts"
  - "Failing to calculate and plot BMI-for-age, which begins at the 24-month visit"
  - "Confusing standing height with recumbent length -- standing height may be 1-2 cm less, which is normal at the transition"
  - "Not administering or properly interpreting the M-CHAT-R/F screening tool at the 24-month visit"
  - "Adopting a 'wait and see' approach to language delay instead of referring to speech therapy and audiology"
  - "Forgetting lead screening for Medicaid-enrolled children, which is required at 12 and 24 months"
  - "Overlooking the HepA #2 catch-up dose if not yet given"
  - "Not assessing dental health or applying fluoride varnish"
  - "Recommending whole milk beyond age 2 when the transition to low-fat milk should occur"
  - "Providing no guidance on toilet training readiness or pressuring parents to start too early"
  - "Missing early signs of autism because the child is 'too young' -- 24 months is an optimal screening window"
  - "Not distinguishing physiologic bowlegs (improving genu varum) from pathologic bowing (worsening, asymmetric, or associated with lateral thrust)"
  - "Failing to ask about screen time and not counseling on the 1-hour daily limit"

possible_findings:
  - finding: "Language delay"
    description: "Fewer than 50 words in expressive vocabulary, absence of 2-word combinations, limited gestures, or poor receptive language. Parents may report 'he understands everything but just doesn't talk.'"
    probability: 0.15
    framework_link: "speech_delay.yaml"
    age_relevance: "24 months is the critical identification window. By this age, children should have 50+ words and 2-word phrases. Referral to speech-language pathology and audiology should not be delayed."
  - finding: "Positive M-CHAT-R/F (autism spectrum disorder concern)"
    description: "Positive screen on M-CHAT-R/F (score >= 3) with concerning follow-up interview. May present with limited eye contact, absent pointing, no pretend play, language delay, repetitive behaviors, or regression of previously acquired skills."
    probability: 0.05
    framework_link: "autism.yaml"
    age_relevance: "24-month screening is the second routine M-CHAT window (after 18 months). Early identification allows earlier access to intensive behavioral interventions, which have the strongest evidence for improving outcomes when started before age 3."
  - finding: "Elevated blood lead level"
    description: "Blood lead level >= 3.5 mcg/dL (CDC 2021 reference value). Child may be asymptomatic or present with irritability, developmental delay, abdominal pain, or constipation at higher levels."
    probability: 0.04
    framework_link: null
    age_relevance: "24-month screening is required for Medicaid-enrolled children. Peak lead levels typically occur at 18-36 months due to hand-to-mouth behavior and increased mobility. Levels >= 3.5 mcg/dL require environmental assessment and follow-up testing."
  - finding: "Behavioral concerns (tantrums, aggression, defiance)"
    description: "Parents report frequent, intense, or prolonged tantrums, aggressive behavior toward other children or adults, extreme defiance, or inability to be soothed. Must differentiate normal toddler behavior from emerging behavioral disorder."
    probability: 0.12
    framework_link: null
    age_relevance: "Peak tantrum frequency occurs between 18-36 months. Most behavioral concerns at this age are developmentally normal. Red flags: self-injurious behavior, no calming within 15-20 minutes, aggression without provocation, or regression."
  - finding: "Obesity or overweight (elevated BMI-for-age)"
    description: "BMI-for-age >= 85th percentile (overweight) or >= 95th percentile (obesity) on CDC growth charts. May note rapid weight gain crossing percentiles or excess weight-for-length prior to BMI calculation."
    probability: 0.10
    framework_link: "obesity.yaml"
    age_relevance: "BMI-for-age begins at 24 months. Early identification of obesity trajectory allows early intervention with nutrition counseling and activity promotion. Assess family history of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease."
  - finding: "Growth faltering (failure to thrive)"
    description: "Weight-for-age or BMI-for-age below the 5th percentile, or crossing downward across 2 or more major percentile lines. May present with picky eating, food refusal, or developmental concerns."
    probability: 0.04
    framework_link: "failure_to_thrive.yaml"
    age_relevance: "Toddler food refusal and picky eating are common and can contribute to poor weight gain. Assess caloric intake, meal patterns, milk intake (excessive milk displaces solid food), and psychosocial factors."
  - finding: "Early childhood caries"
    description: "White spot lesions or brown discoloration on primary teeth, especially upper incisors. May have visible cavities, broken or discolored teeth, or gum swelling."
    probability: 0.08
    framework_link: null
    age_relevance: "ECC can begin as early as tooth eruption. By 24 months, most children have 16+ teeth. Major modifiable risk factors include nighttime bottle with milk/juice and absence of tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste."
  - finding: "Iron deficiency anemia"
    description: "Pallor, fatigue, irritability, pica behavior, or asymptomatic with microcytic anemia found on screening labs. Hemoglobin < 11 g/dL at this age."
    probability: 0.06
    framework_link: "iron_deficiency_anemia.yaml"
    age_relevance: "Common at 24 months due to high milk intake displacing iron-rich foods, picky eating, and rapid growth. Excessive cow's milk (> 24 oz/day) is the most common dietary cause. Screen with CBC if not done at 12 months or if risk factors present."
  - finding: "Physiologic genu varum (bowlegs)"
    description: "Bilateral symmetric bowing of the lower extremities. Intercondylar distance may be up to 6 cm. No lateral thrust with walking, normal height velocity."
    probability: 0.10
    framework_link: "lower_extremity_alignment.yaml"
    age_relevance: "Physiologic bowing peaks at 12-18 months and should be improving by 24 months with transition toward neutral alignment. Progression to genu valgum (knock-knees) occurs by age 3-4. Persistent or worsening bowing warrants evaluation for Blount disease or metabolic bone disease."

parent_styles:
  - "anxious parent concerned about language development comparing to other children the same age"
  - "parent resistant to autism screening, stating 'he's just a late talker' or 'boys talk later'"
