# Roseola - Teaching Framework
topic: "Roseola Infantum"
aliases: ["exanthem subitum", "sixth disease", "HHV-6", "three-day fever"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [6, 36]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize classic presentation pattern"
  - "Understand rash appears as fever resolves"
  - "Know about febrile seizure risk"
  - "Differentiate from other viral exanthems"
  - "Counsel on supportive care"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating with antibiotics during fever phase"
  - "Diagnosing rash too early (before fever defervescence)"
  - "Missing febrile seizure as presenting symptom"
  - "Unnecessary workup during high fever phase"
  - "Confusing with measles or rubella"

red_flags:
  - "Prolonged or complex febrile seizure"
  - "Persistent fever > 5 days"
  - "Toxic appearance"
  - "Signs of encephalitis (altered mental status)"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Classic: 3-5 days high fever (often 104F+), then rash as fever breaks"
  - "Rash: rose-pink macules and papules, starts on trunk, spreads outward"
  - "Rash is non-pruritic, blanching"
  - "Child typically looks well despite high fever"
  - "HHV-6 causes 95% of cases; HHV-7 causes remainder"
  - "Peak age: 6-15 months"
  - "Febrile seizures occur in 10-15% of cases"
  - "By age 2, nearly all children have been infected"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration and pattern of fever?"
  - "When did rash appear relative to fever?"
  - "Child's behavior during fever - well-appearing or ill?"
  - "Any seizure activity?"
  - "Rash itchy?"
  - "Other symptoms: URI, diarrhea?"
  - "Sick contacts?"
  - "Immunization status?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Rash distribution: trunk first, then extremities"
  - "Rash character: blanching, maculopapular, rose-pink"
  - "Periorbital edema (common)"
  - "Mild lymphadenopathy (occipital, cervical)"
  - "Examination otherwise unremarkable"
  - "Red tympanic membranes common (not necessarily AOM)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Supportive care only"
  - "Antipyretics for fever/comfort"
  - "Adequate hydration"
  - "No antiviral treatment needed"
  - "No isolation necessary once afebrile"
  - "Febrile seizure precautions during fever phase"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All typical cases"
  - "Return precautions: Persistent fever > 5 days, seizure, lethargy"
  - "Daycare: Can return when afebrile; rash is not contagious stage"
  - "Follow-up: Not routinely needed if classic presentation"

parent_styles: [anxious, first-time-parent, fever-phobic]
