# Night Terrors - Teaching Framework
topic: "Sleep Terrors"
aliases: ["night terrors", "pavor nocturnus"]
category: neurology
age_range_months: [18, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish night terrors from nightmares"
  - "Understand they occur during non-REM sleep"
  - "Recognize benign nature"
  - "Know when further evaluation is needed"
  - "Counsel parents on management"

common_mistakes:
  - "Confusing with nightmares (different sleep stage)"
  - "Trying to wake child during episode"
  - "Ordering unnecessary EEGs"
  - "Attributing to psychological trauma"
  - "Missing sleep deprivation as trigger"

red_flags:
  - "Episodes occurring multiple times per night"
  - "Stereotyped movements concerning for seizure"
  - "Daytime sleepiness"
  - "Symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, pauses)"
  - "Developmental concerns"
  - "Onset in adolescence"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Night terrors: 1-3 hours after falling asleep (non-REM)"
  - "Nightmares: later in night (REM sleep), child recalls dream"
  - "Child sits up, screams, appears terrified, inconsolable"
  - "Eyes open but not responsive to environment"
  - "No memory of event in morning"
  - "Episode lasts 1-15 minutes"
  - "Sleep deprivation and irregular schedules are triggers"
  - "Family history common"

key_history_questions:
  - "What time does episode occur after falling asleep?"
  - "What happens during episode? Describe behaviors."
  - "Does child remember episode in morning?"
  - "Can you wake or console them during episode?"
  - "Regular bedtime? Getting enough sleep?"
  - "Snoring or breathing pauses?"
  - "Recent schedule changes, stress, illness?"
  - "Family history of sleep disorders?"
  - "Any daytime sleepiness or behavior issues?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Normal examination"
  - "Normal neurologic exam"
  - "Tonsil size (adenotonsillar hypertrophy can worsen)"
  - "Growth and development normal"
  - "No signs of sleep deprivation in daytime"

treatment_principles:
  - "Reassurance - benign and typically outgrown"
  - "Maintain consistent sleep schedule"
  - "Ensure adequate sleep duration"
  - "Keep child safe during episode - don't try to wake"
  - "Wait for episode to end naturally"
  - "Scheduled awakening if predictable timing"
  - "Address underlying sleep disorders if present"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Classic presentation"
  - "Sleep study: Suspected sleep apnea, frequent episodes"
  - "Neurology referral: Atypical features, concern for seizures"
  - "ENT referral: Significant adenotonsillar hypertrophy"
  - "Follow-up: Routine, typically resolve by adolescence"
