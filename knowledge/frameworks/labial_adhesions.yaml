# Labial Adhesions - Teaching Framework
topic: "Labial Adhesions"
aliases: ["labial fusion", "labial agglutination", "fused labia"]
category: gynecology
age_range_months: [3, 72]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize labial adhesions on exam"
  - "Understand hypoestrogenic cause"
  - "Know when treatment is needed"
  - "Apply topical estrogen appropriately"
  - "Counsel on natural resolution"

common_mistakes:
  - "Forcibly separating adhesions (painful, high recurrence)"
  - "Over-treating asymptomatic adhesions"
  - "Missing urinary retention in complete adhesions"
  - "Not counseling on estrogen side effects"
  - "Confusing with congenital absence of vagina"

red_flags:
  - "Complete adhesion with urinary symptoms"
  - "Urinary retention"
  - "Recurrent UTIs"
  - "Inability to identify urethral meatus"
  - "Suspected sexual abuse"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Peak incidence: 13-23 months (hypoestrogenic state)"
  - "Thin, pale midline raphe = fused labia minora"
  - "Usually starts posteriorly, can become complete"
  - "Most asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously by puberty"
  - "Treatment only if symptomatic or complete"
  - "Estrogen cream dissolves adhesions in 2-6 weeks"
  - "Apply thin layer BID to line of fusion"
  - "Recurrence common after treatment"

key_history_questions:
  - "When did you notice this?"
  - "Any urinary symptoms - pain, dribbling, retention?"
  - "UTI history?"
  - "Any vulvar irritation or discharge?"
  - "Previous treatment attempts?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Thin, pale midline line where labia should separate"
  - "Partial vs complete fusion"
  - "Can identify urethral meatus?"
  - "Can identify vaginal opening?"
  - "Signs of vulvovaginitis"
  - "Signs of irritation or trauma"

treatment_principles:
  - "Asymptomatic, partial: observation and reassurance"
  - "Symptomatic or complete: topical estrogen cream"
  - "Estrogen cream: thin layer BID x 2-6 weeks"
  - "Then emollient (petroleum jelly) to prevent recurrence"
  - "NEVER manually separate (painful, high recurrence)"
  - "Counsel on estrogen side effects (breast budding, rare)"
  - "Alternative: betamethasone 0.05% if estrogen concerns"
  - "Most resolve by puberty without treatment"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Treat if: Complete adhesion, urinary symptoms, recurrent UTI"
  - "Observation if: Partial, asymptomatic"
  - "Follow-up: 4-6 weeks after starting treatment"
  - "GYN referral: Not responding, recurrent, urinary obstruction"
  - "Recurrence prevention: Barrier ointment nightly after treatment"
