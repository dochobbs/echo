# Insect Bites and Stings - Teaching Framework
topic: "Insect Bites and Stings"
aliases: ["bug bites", "bee sting", "mosquito bites", "spider bite"]
category: environmental
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish local reaction from cellulitis"
  - "Recognize anaphylaxis and systemic reactions"
  - "Know when antibiotics are indicated"
  - "Identify high-risk bites (brown recluse, black widow)"
  - "Counsel on prevention and symptomatic care"

common_mistakes:
  - "Treating local reaction as cellulitis"
  - "Diagnosing 'spider bite' without evidence (usually staph)"
  - "Missing embedded stinger"
  - "Not asking about systemic symptoms"
  - "Prescribing antibiotics for uncomplicated bites"

red_flags:
  - "Anaphylaxis symptoms (throat tightness, wheezing, hypotension)"
  - "Large local reaction with fever"
  - "Spreading erythema with streaking"
  - "Necrotic center (brown recluse concern)"
  - "Muscle cramps, abdominal pain (black widow)"
  - "Multiple stings (>10)"
  - "Sting in mouth/throat"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Local reaction: immediate swelling, peaks 24-48h, can be large"
  - "Cellulitis: develops 24-48h later, warm, spreading, +/- fever"
  - "Large local reactions (>10cm) are IgE-mediated, not infection"
  - "Most 'spider bites' are actually MRSA skin infections"
  - "Bee stingers should be scraped off, not squeezed"
  - "Fire ant stings cause sterile pustules - don't pop"
  - "Serum sickness-like reaction can occur days later"

key_history_questions:
  - "What bit/stung? Did you see it?"
  - "When did it happen?"
  - "Any breathing difficulty or throat tightness?"
  - "Any dizziness, hives elsewhere, or swelling of lips/face?"
  - "Previous reactions to stings?"
  - "Is it getting better or worse?"
  - "Any fever?"
  - "Where did it happen (geography, indoors/outdoors)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Local swelling, erythema size"
  - "Warmth and tenderness"
  - "Central punctum or stinger"
  - "Lymphangitic streaking"
  - "Regional lymphadenopathy"
  - "Assess for systemic: vitals, wheezing, urticaria"
  - "Necrosis or eschar"
  - "Mark edges to monitor spread"

treatment_principles:
  - "Local reaction: ice, elevation, antihistamine, topical steroid"
  - "Remove stinger by scraping (not squeezing)"
  - "Oral antihistamine for itching"
  - "Oral steroids for large local reactions"
  - "Antibiotics only if true cellulitis develops"
  - "Epinephrine for anaphylaxis"
  - "Tetanus update if needed"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most local reactions"
  - "Observation: Large local reaction with oral steroids"
  - "ED: Any systemic symptoms, anaphylaxis"
  - "Allergist referral: Systemic reaction to Hymenoptera for venom immunotherapy"
  - "Return: Spreading redness, fever, worsening after 48h"
