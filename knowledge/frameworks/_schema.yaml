# Lightweight Teaching Framework Schema
#
# Each framework is ~40-60 lines focused on TEACHING, not patient simulation.
# Claude generates patient details dynamically at case start.
#
# ============ REQUIRED FIELDS ============
#
# topic: Display name for the condition
#   Example: "Acute Otitis Media"
#
# category: Clinical category
#   Options: infectious | respiratory | gi | derm | behavioral | newborn |
#            emergency | msk | endo | nephro | heme | adolescent | ent | neuro
#
# age_range_months: [min, max] typical age range
#   Example: [6, 36]
#
# teaching_goals: List of 3-5 learning objectives (what learner should understand)
#   - Should be specific and measurable
#   - Focus on clinical decision-making, not just facts
#   Example:
#     - "Distinguish AOM from otitis media with effusion (OME)"
#     - "Apply AAP observation vs treatment criteria"
#
# common_mistakes: List of 3-5 typical learner errors
#   - Focus on clinically significant errors
#   - Include both diagnostic and management errors
#   Example:
#     - "Treating OME with antibiotics"
#     - "Using standard-dose instead of high-dose amoxicillin"
#
# red_flags: List of 3-5 must-not-miss findings
#   - Safety-critical items that require immediate action
#   Example:
#     - "Mastoiditis (postauricular swelling)"
#     - "Facial nerve palsy"
#
# clinical_pearls: List of 3-5 high-yield teaching points
#   - Memorable, practical insights
#   - Include specific numbers/thresholds where helpful
#   Example:
#     - "Bulging TM is the key finding - redness alone is not diagnostic"
#     - "High-dose amox: 80-90 mg/kg/day divided BID"
#
# ============ RECOMMENDED FIELDS ============
#
# key_history_questions: What to ask in history
#   - 5-8 essential questions the learner should ask
#   Example:
#     - "Duration of symptoms?"
#     - "Fever pattern?"
#     - "Previous ear infections?"
#
# key_exam_findings: What to look for on exam
#   - 4-6 essential examination components
#   Example:
#     - "TM appearance (bulging, erythema, mobility)"
#     - "Mastoid tenderness"
#
# treatment_principles: General approach (not specific doses)
#   - High-level treatment guidance
#   - Let CDS module handle specific dosing
#   Example:
#     - "High-dose amoxicillin is first-line"
#     - "Consider observation in mild, unilateral cases age >2"
#
# disposition_guidance: When to admit, refer, or observe
#   - Clear criteria for escalation
#   Example:
#     - "Admit: Mastoiditis, failed outpatient therapy"
#     - "Outpatient: Uncomplicated AOM in well-appearing child"
#
# ============ OPTIONAL FIELDS ============
#
# aliases: Alternative names for the condition
#   Example: ["ear infection", "AOM", "middle ear infection"]
#
# differential_diagnosis: What else to consider
#   - 3-5 important differential considerations
#   Example:
#     - "Otitis media with effusion (no signs of acute infection)"
#     - "Otitis externa (canal involvement, tragal tenderness)"
#
# seasonality: Seasonal patterns
#   peak_months: [11, 12, 1, 2, 3]
#   pattern: "winter predominance"
#
# parent_styles: Types of parent presentations to vary
#   - Simple list of style keywords
#   Example: [anxious, experienced, antibiotic-seeking, antibiotic-hesitant]
#
# age_specific_considerations: Different approaches by age
#   - Use when age significantly changes management
#   Example:
#     infant:
#       age_months: [6, 24]
#       notes: "Lower threshold for treatment"
#     older_child:
#       age_months: [24, 144]
#       notes: "Observation option for mild unilateral"
#
# sources: References for guidelines
#   Example:
#     - "AAP Clinical Practice Guideline (2013)"
#     - "IDSA Guidelines"
#
# images: Visual aids for teaching (curated public domain)
#   - Use CDC, NIH, AAP public domain images when available
#   - key: identifier for the image (used in code)
#   - url: full URL to image (or "PLACEHOLDER" if not yet sourced)
#   - caption: educational caption explaining what to observe
#   - phase: when to show the image (intro, history, exam, assessment, debrief)
#   - alt_text: accessibility description
#   - source: attribution (e.g., "CDC Public Health Image Library")
#   Example:
#     images:
#       - key: "tm_bulging"
#         url: "https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=..."
#         caption: "Bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane diagnostic of AOM"
#         phase: exam
#         alt_text: "Otoscopic view of bulging red tympanic membrane"
#         source: "CDC PHIL"
