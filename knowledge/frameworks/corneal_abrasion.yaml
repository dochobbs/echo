# Corneal Abrasion - Teaching Framework
topic: "Corneal Abrasion"
aliases: ["scratched eye", "cornea scratch", "eye injury"]
category: ophthalmology
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Perform fluorescein examination"
  - "Distinguish simple abrasion from complicated injury"
  - "Know current evidence on patching (don't patch)"
  - "Recognize contact lens-related abrasions (Pseudomonas risk)"
  - "Identify when ophthalmology referral needed"

common_mistakes:
  - "Patching the eye (no longer recommended)"
  - "Missing foreign body"
  - "Prescribing topical anesthetics for home use"
  - "Not checking visual acuity"
  - "Missing corneal ulcer in contact lens wearer"

red_flags:
  - "Contact lens wearer (Pseudomonas risk)"
  - "White infiltrate on cornea (ulcer)"
  - "Deep or large abrasion"
  - "Hyphema (blood in anterior chamber)"
  - "Irregular or fixed pupil"
  - "Decreased visual acuity"
  - "Organic material or high-velocity injury (penetrating)"
  - "Not improving in 24-48 hours"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Fluorescein: uptake indicates epithelial defect"
  - "Use cobalt blue light or Wood's lamp to see uptake"
  - "Vertical linear abrasions: think foreign body under upper lid"
  - "Patching does NOT improve healing and may delay it"
  - "Most heal in 24-72 hours"
  - "Tetracaine at visit OK, but never prescribe for home (toxic)"
  - "Contact lens wearers: antipseudomonal coverage, NO patching"
  - "Topical NSAIDs provide analgesia without anesthetic toxicity"

key_history_questions:
  - "What happened? Mechanism?"
  - "When did it happen?"
  - "Contact lens wearer?"
  - "Foreign body sensation or actual FB?"
  - "Vision changes?"
  - "Tearing, photophobia?"
  - "High-velocity injury (grinding, hammering)?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Visual acuity (each eye)"
  - "External exam: lids, lashes, conjunctiva"
  - "Evert upper lid: look for foreign body"
  - "Fluorescein uptake pattern"
  - "Pupil shape and reactivity"
  - "Anterior chamber: hyphema, hypopyon"
  - "Seidel test if penetrating injury suspected"

treatment_principles:
  - "NO patching (evidence shows no benefit, may delay healing)"
  - "Topical antibiotic: erythromycin ointment or fluoroquinolone drops"
  - "Contact lens: fluoroquinolone drops (antipseudomonal)"
  - "Pain: oral analgesics, topical NSAIDs (ketorolac)"
  - "NO topical anesthetics for home use (delays healing, toxic)"
  - "Cycloplegic (cyclopentolate) optional for severe pain"
  - "Remove foreign body if present"
  - "Tetanus if dirty injury and not up to date"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Simple small abrasions"
  - "24-hour follow-up: Contact lens related, large abrasions"
  - "Ophthalmology same day: Ulcer, infiltrate, deep injury, not improving"
  - "ED/ophthalmology: Penetrating injury, hyphema, vision loss"
  - "Return: Not improving in 24-48h, worsening pain, vision change"
