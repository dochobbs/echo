# Anaphylaxis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Anaphylaxis"
aliases: ["allergic reaction", "severe allergy", "anaphylactic shock"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [0, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize epinephrine has NO contraindications in anaphylaxis"
  - "Know biphasic reaction risk"
  - "Understand positioning importance"
  - "Prescribe epinephrine auto-injector appropriately"

common_mistakes:
  - "Giving antihistamines instead of epinephrine"
  - "Delaying epinephrine for 'mild' reactions"
  - "Letting patient sit or stand (Empty Vena Cava syndrome)"
  - "Not warning about biphasic reaction"

red_flags:
  - "Respiratory compromise (stridor, wheeze, hypoxia)"
  - "Cardiovascular compromise (hypotension, tachycardia)"
  - "Rapidly progressing symptoms"
  - "History of severe reactions"

clinical_pearls:
  - "EPINEPHRINE FIRST - NO contraindications in anaphylaxis"
  - "Antihistamines do NOT treat respiratory/cardiovascular collapse"
  - "Biphasic reaction: Can occur 1-72h later - warn about return precautions"
  - "Keep SUPINE with legs elevated - prevents Empty Vena Cava syndrome"

key_history_questions:
  - "What was the exposure (food, insect, medication)?"
  - "Time from exposure to symptoms?"
  - "Symptoms - skin, respiratory, GI, cardiovascular?"
  - "Previous reactions to this trigger?"
  - "Do you have an epinephrine auto-injector? Did you use it?"
  - "Any medications taken before coming in?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Vital signs (hypotension, tachycardia)"
  - "Skin (urticaria, flushing, angioedema)"
  - "Respiratory (stridor, wheeze, work of breathing)"
  - "Oxygenation"
  - "Mental status"

treatment_principles:
  - "Epinephrine IM 0.01 mg/kg (max 0.5mg) - FIRST LINE"
  - "Repeat epinephrine q5-15min as needed"
  - "Position: Supine, legs elevated"
  - "Adjuncts: Antihistamines, steroids, fluids"
  - "Observe minimum 4-6 hours for biphasic reaction"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Observe: Minimum 4-6 hours after resolution"
  - "Admit: Severe reaction, multiple epinephrine doses, high-risk features"
  - "Discharge with: Epinephrine auto-injector prescription, action plan"
