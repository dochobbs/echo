# Drowning - Teaching Framework
topic: "Drowning"
aliases: ["drowning", "submersion injury", "near-drowning"]
category: emergency
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know drowning is leading cause of death in 1-4 year olds"
  - "Understand 'dry drowning' is a myth"
  - "Recognize who needs observation vs can go home"
  - "Counsel on prevention at every visit"

common_mistakes:
  - "Worrying about 'dry drowning' days later (not a real entity)"
  - "Not counseling on water safety at well visits"
  - "Discharging symptomatic patients too early"
  - "Not considering intentional injury in unusual circumstances"

red_flags:
  - "Any respiratory symptoms (cough, tachypnea, hypoxia)"
  - "Altered mental status"
  - "Prolonged submersion (>5 minutes)"
  - "Required CPR at scene"
  - "Aspiration"

clinical_pearls:
  - "There is no 'dry drowning' or 'secondary drowning' days later - these are myths"
  - "If asymptomatic after submersion with brief observation (4-6 hours), safe to discharge"
  - "Symptomatic patients need admission for monitoring"
  - "Drowning peaks: 1-4 years (pools) and 15-19 years (lakes, rivers, alcohol)"
  - "Survival depends on duration of submersion, temperature, immediate CPR"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of submersion?"
  - "Was child conscious when pulled out?"
  - "CPR performed? How long?"
  - "Any vomiting or aspiration?"
  - "Current symptoms: Cough, trouble breathing?"
  - "Water type (pool, lake, bathtub)?"
  - "Supervision - who was watching?"
  - "Any seizure activity?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Respiratory: Rate, effort, breath sounds, O2 saturation"
  - "Mental status - GCS"
  - "Vital signs"
  - "Signs of trauma (head/neck injury if diving)"
  - "Temperature (hypothermia)"
  - "Signs of aspiration (crackles)"

treatment_principles:
  - "ABCs - standard resuscitation if needed"
  - "Supplemental oxygen for hypoxia"
  - "Chest X-ray if symptomatic"
  - "Asymptomatic: 4-6 hour observation, normal CXR → can discharge"
  - "Symptomatic: Admit for monitoring"
  - "Severe: ICU, may need intubation, ECMO in select cases"
  - "Warm slowly if hypothermic"

disposition_guidance:
  - "ED: All submersion events"
  - "Home: Asymptomatic after 4-6 hours observation, normal CXR"
  - "Admit: Any respiratory symptoms, hypoxia, aspiration"
  - "ICU: Required CPR, prolonged submersion, altered mental status"
  - "Counsel on prevention: Fencing, supervision, swim lessons"
