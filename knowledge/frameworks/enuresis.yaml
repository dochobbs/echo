# Enuresis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Enuresis"
aliases: ["bedwetting", "nocturnal enuresis", "enuresis"]
category: nephrology
age_range_months: [60, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know primary nocturnal enuresis is common and usually self-limited"
  - "Distinguish primary from secondary enuresis"
  - "Avoid extensive workup for typical presentation"
  - "Counsel on behavioral treatments and medication options"

common_mistakes:
  - "Extensive workup for typical primary nocturnal enuresis"
  - "Starting medication without behavioral interventions"
  - "Not addressing psychosocial impact"
  - "Missing secondary enuresis (new onset after 6+ months dry)"

red_flags:
  - "Secondary enuresis (was dry >6 months, now wetting)"
  - "Daytime incontinence"
  - "UTI symptoms"
  - "Constipation (very common cause)"
  - "Polyuria, polydipsia (diabetes)"
  - "Signs of abuse or trauma"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Primary nocturnal enuresis: Normal development, never achieved dryness; 15% of 5-year-olds"
  - "Resolves spontaneously: 15%/year (85% of 5-year-olds → 1-2% of teens)"
  - "Constipation: VERY common cause - always address this first"
  - "Alarm therapy: Most effective long-term; 70% success, low relapse"
  - "Desmopressin: Fast-acting but high relapse when stopped; good for sleepovers"

key_history_questions:
  - "Ever been dry at night for 6+ months? (Primary vs secondary)"
  - "Daytime wetting?"
  - "Constipation? Stool pattern?"
  - "Bedtime fluid intake?"
  - "Snoring? (Sleep apnea)"
  - "Polyuria, polydipsia?"
  - "UTI symptoms?"
  - "Family history of bedwetting?"
  - "Psychosocial: Impact, sleepovers, punishments, stressors?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Abdominal exam - stool burden (constipation)"
  - "Genital exam - normal anatomy"
  - "Lower back - dimple, tuft (spinal dysraphism)"
  - "Neurologic exam - gait, reflexes, sensation"
  - "Usually normal in primary nocturnal enuresis"

treatment_principles:
  - "Treat constipation FIRST - resolves many cases"
  - "Behavioral: Limit evening fluids, void before bed, positive reinforcement"
  - "Enuresis alarm: Most effective long-term treatment; takes 2-3 months, low relapse"
  - "Desmopressin (DDAVP): For quick results, sleepovers; high relapse when stopped"
  - "Imipramine: Second-line; risk of overdose toxicity"
  - "Reassurance: Will get better with time"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Primary nocturnal enuresis"
  - "Minimal workup: Urinalysis (to rule out UTI, glucosuria, proteinuria)"
  - "No imaging for typical primary nocturnal enuresis"
  - "Urology/nephrology: Secondary enuresis, daytime symptoms, treatment failure"
  - "Follow-up: Every 3-6 months to assess progress"

parent_styles: [frustrated-with-bedwetting, wanting-quick-fix, blaming-child, supportive]
