# Conjunctivitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Conjunctivitis"
aliases: ["pink eye", "red eye"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [1, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Distinguish bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis"
  - "Recognize ophthalmia neonatorum as an emergency"
  - "Know when antibiotics are indicated vs watchful waiting"
  - "Identify red flags requiring ophthalmology referral"
  - "Understand school/daycare return policies"

common_mistakes:
  - "Prescribing antibiotics for clearly viral conjunctivitis"
  - "Missing gonococcal ophthalmia in neonates"
  - "Not asking about contact lens use in adolescents"
  - "Overlooking associated periorbital cellulitis"
  - "Missing foreign body as cause"

red_flags:
  - "Neonatal conjunctivitis (< 28 days) - gonococcal emergency"
  - "Decreased visual acuity"
  - "Severe pain out of proportion"
  - "Corneal opacity or ulceration"
  - "Periorbital swelling (cellulitis)"
  - "Contact lens wearer with pain"
  - "Photophobia"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Viral: watery discharge, preauricular lymphadenopathy, often bilateral"
  - "Bacterial: purulent discharge, often unilateral initially"
  - "Allergic: itching prominent, bilateral, boggy conjunctiva"
  - "Most bacterial conjunctivitis is self-limited (5-7 days)"
  - "Antibiotics shorten duration by ~1 day"
  - "Ophthalmia neonatorum: Chlamydia (5-14 days), Gonococcal (2-5 days)"

key_history_questions:
  - "Discharge character - watery vs purulent?"
  - "One eye or both?"
  - "Itching?"
  - "Pain or photophobia?"
  - "Recent cold symptoms?"
  - "Contact lens use?"
  - "Sick contacts?"
  - "For neonates: maternal STI history?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Conjunctival injection pattern"
  - "Discharge character"
  - "Preauricular lymphadenopathy"
  - "Eyelid swelling"
  - "Visual acuity (if cooperative)"
  - "Pupil reactivity"
  - "Cornea clarity"

treatment_principles:
  - "Viral: supportive care, cool compresses, hand hygiene"
  - "Bacterial: polymyxin-trimethoprim or erythromycin drops"
  - "Allergic: antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer drops"
  - "Gonococcal neonatal: IV ceftriaxone, ophthalmology STAT"
  - "Chlamydial neonatal: oral erythromycin x 14 days"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Most cases"
  - "Urgent ophthalmology: Corneal involvement, severe pain, vision change"
  - "Emergency: Neonatal gonococcal, periorbital cellulitis"
  - "Return to school: 24h after starting antibiotics (bacterial) or when discharge resolves"
