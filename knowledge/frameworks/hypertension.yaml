# Pediatric Hypertension - Teaching Framework
topic: "Pediatric Hypertension"
aliases: ["hypertension", "high blood pressure", "elevated BP"]
category: nephrology
age_range_months: [36, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know to use proper cuff size and technique"
  - "Apply 2017 AAP guidelines for BP classification"
  - "Understand secondary causes more common in children"
  - "Screen appropriately starting at age 3"

common_mistakes:
  - "Using wrong cuff size (too small = falsely high)"
  - "Diagnosing HTN on single reading"
  - "Not evaluating for secondary causes in children"
  - "Missing white coat hypertension"

red_flags:
  - "Stage 2 hypertension (≥95th + 12 mmHg or ≥140/90)"
  - "End-organ damage (LVH, retinopathy, proteinuria)"
  - "Secondary causes (renal, cardiac, endocrine)"
  - "Hypertensive emergency (symptoms + severely elevated)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Cuff size: Bladder width ≥40% of arm circumference - use larger if between sizes"
  - "2017 AAP: Simplified table for ages 1-13 (≥130/80 for all ≥13 years old)"
  - "Three separate elevated readings needed for diagnosis"
  - "Secondary causes: Renal disease most common; more likely if younger, severe, or symptomatic"
  - "Ambulatory BP monitoring: Confirms diagnosis, detects white coat HTN"

key_history_questions:
  - "Headaches, vision changes, chest pain?"
  - "History of urinary tract infections, kidney problems?"
  - "Snoring, sleep apnea symptoms?"
  - "Family history of hypertension, kidney disease, heart disease?"
  - "Medications, supplements, energy drinks?"
  - "Diet, salt intake?"
  - "Physical activity level?"
  - "Obesity history?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Blood pressure: Correct technique, correct cuff, seated, after rest"
  - "Repeat if elevated"
  - "BMI"
  - "Fundoscopic exam"
  - "Cardiac exam (S3, S4, murmurs)"
  - "Abdominal bruits (renal artery stenosis)"
  - "Femoral pulses (coarctation)"
  - "Signs of endocrine disorders (thyroid, cushingoid)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Confirm diagnosis: 3 separate visits with elevated BP"
  - "Lifestyle first: DASH diet, sodium restriction, weight management, exercise"
  - "Medications if: Stage 2, stage 1 + symptoms/target organ damage, or lifestyle fails"
  - "First-line: ACE inhibitor or ARB (especially if proteinuria), CCB, or thiazide"
  - "Target: <90th percentile or <130/80 for teens"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Reconfirm: 3 separate readings needed for diagnosis"
  - "Labs: BMP, urinalysis, lipids"
  - "Echo: If starting medication or sustained hypertension"
  - "Nephrology: Secondary hypertension suspected, refractory, young child"
  - "Ambulatory BP monitoring: Confirm diagnosis, white coat HTN"
  - "Urgent: Stage 2 with symptoms = hypertensive emergency"

parent_styles: [surprised-by-diagnosis, family-history-aware, skeptical]
