# ADHD - Teaching Framework
topic: "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder"
aliases: ["ADHD", "ADD", "attention deficit"]
category: behavioral
age_range_months: [48, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know DSM-5 criteria and multi-setting requirement"
  - "Recognize methylphenidate as first-line treatment"
  - "Understand comorbidity is the rule, not exception"
  - "Address parent concerns about medication"

common_mistakes:
  - "Diagnosing based on school report alone (need multiple settings)"
  - "Not screening for comorbidities (anxiety, learning disabilities)"
  - "Starting stimulant without baseline weight, BP, HR"
  - "Not adjusting dose to optimize function"

red_flags:
  - "Symptoms only in one setting (consider other causes)"
  - "Acute onset (consider medical causes, trauma, abuse)"
  - "Significant cardiac history (pre-stimulant evaluation)"
  - "Severe comorbid depression or anxiety"

clinical_pearls:
  - "DSM-5: 6+ symptoms, multiple settings, before age 12, >6 months"
  - "Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) is FIRST-LINE pharmacotherapy"
  - "Get ratings from BOTH parents and teachers (Vanderbilt, Conners)"
  - "Comorbidities: 60-70% have at least one (anxiety, ODD, LD, depression)"
  - "Monitor: Height, weight, BP, HR at every visit"

key_history_questions:
  - "What symptoms? In what settings (home, school, activities)?"
  - "When did you first notice? (Must be before age 12)"
  - "Academic performance? Social functioning?"
  - "Family history of ADHD?"
  - "Any anxiety, mood symptoms, tics?"
  - "Birth/developmental history?"
  - "Sleep habits? Screen time?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Baseline height, weight (for stimulant monitoring)"
  - "Blood pressure, heart rate"
  - "Cardiac exam (murmurs)"
  - "Developmental/neurologic exam"
  - "Observe for tics"
  - "Office behavior (may be normal - novel environment)"

treatment_principles:
  - "First-line: Stimulant medication (methylphenidate or amphetamine)"
  - "Start low, titrate to optimal dose (not just 'adequate')"
  - "Behavioral therapy: Recommended for all, especially preschool"
  - "School: 504 plan or IEP accommodations"
  - "Monitor: Growth, BP, HR, tics, mood at each visit"
  - "Preschool (4-5): Behavioral therapy FIRST before medication"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Psychiatry/developmental pediatrics: Complex cases, treatment-refractory"
  - "Cardiology: If significant cardiac history before starting stimulant"
  - "Follow-up: Monthly during titration, then every 3-6 months"

parent_styles: [anti-medication, wants-quick-diagnosis, exhausted, well-informed]
