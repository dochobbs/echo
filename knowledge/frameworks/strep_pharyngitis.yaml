# Strep Pharyngitis - Teaching Framework
topic: "Streptococcal Pharyngitis"
aliases: ["strep throat", "GAS pharyngitis", "sore throat"]
category: infectious
age_range_months: [36, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know when to test and when NOT to test"
  - "Understand negative rapid test requires culture backup in children"
  - "Recognize carriers do not need treatment"
  - "Prevent overtreatment of viral pharyngitis"

common_mistakes:
  - "Testing children <3 years routinely (rheumatic fever rare)"
  - "Not backing up negative rapid test with culture in children"
  - "Treating asymptomatic carriers"
  - "Using clinical criteria alone to prescribe antibiotics"

red_flags:
  - "Peritonsillar abscess (trismus, uvula deviation, 'hot potato' voice)"
  - "Drooling or inability to swallow"
  - "Toxic appearance"
  - "Severe unilateral swelling"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Do NOT routinely test children <3 years (rheumatic fever rare, atypical presentation)"
  - "Negative rapid test in children MUST be backed up by throat culture"
  - "Do NOT treat asymptomatic carriers (positive test after treatment, no symptoms)"
  - "Centor/McIsaac criteria help stratify but don't replace testing"

key_history_questions:
  - "Duration of sore throat?"
  - "Fever present?"
  - "Any cough? (suggests viral if present)"
  - "Sick contacts with strep?"
  - "Abdominal pain, headache?"
  - "Recent strep infections?"
  - "Any rash?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Tonsillar exudates"
  - "Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (tender)"
  - "Palatal petechiae"
  - "Scarlatiniform rash"
  - "Absence of cough, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis (viral features)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Penicillin VK or Amoxicillin - first line"
  - "10-day course for strep pharyngitis"
  - "Azithromycin for penicillin allergy"
  - "Treatment prevents rheumatic fever, shortens symptoms"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: Uncomplicated strep pharyngitis"
  - "Return precautions: Worsening symptoms, difficulty breathing/swallowing"
  - "Urgent: Peritonsillar abscess, inability to swallow"

differential_diagnosis:
  - "Viral pharyngitis"
  - "Infectious mononucleosis"
  - "Peritonsillar abscess"
  - "Herpangina"
