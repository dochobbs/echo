# Molluscum Contagiosum - Teaching Framework
topic: "Molluscum Contagiosum"
aliases: ["molluscum", "water warts"]
category: dermatology
age_range_months: [12, 144]

teaching_goals:
  - "Recognize characteristic appearance"
  - "Understand natural history and resolution"
  - "Know treatment options and when to treat"
  - "Counsel on transmission prevention"
  - "Recognize when to refer"

common_mistakes:
  - "Over-treating a self-limited condition"
  - "Not counseling on transmission"
  - "Missing extensive disease in immunocompromised"
  - "Confusing with warts"
  - "Aggressive treatment causing scarring"

red_flags:
  - "Extensive or rapidly spreading lesions"
  - "Giant molluscum (> 1 cm)"
  - "Facial involvement near eyes"
  - "Immunocompromised patient"
  - "Secondary bacterial infection"
  - "Lesions in genital area (consider abuse in children)"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Pearly, flesh-colored papules with central umbilication"
  - "Central dimple (umbilication) is key diagnostic feature"
  - "Caused by poxvirus, spread by direct contact or fomites"
  - "Self-limited: resolves in 6-18 months (range 6 months to 5 years)"
  - "Autoinoculation common - lesions spread in clusters"
  - "Eczema predisposes to widespread disease"
  - "BOTE (beginning of the end) sign: surrounding dermatitis heralds resolution"
  - "Curettage, cryotherapy, cantharidin are treatment options"

key_history_questions:
  - "How long have lesions been present?"
  - "Are they spreading?"
  - "Any itching?"
  - "History of eczema?"
  - "Sick contacts with similar lesions?"
  - "Swimming or contact sports?"
  - "Any treatments tried?"
  - "Immunocompromising conditions?"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Discrete, dome-shaped papules"
  - "Central umbilication (dimple)"
  - "Flesh-colored, pink, or white"
  - "Usually 2-5 mm diameter"
  - "Distribution: trunk, extremities, face"
  - "May have surrounding eczematous dermatitis"
  - "Signs of secondary infection"

treatment_principles:
  - "Watchful waiting is appropriate - self-limited"
  - "Treat if: symptomatic, spreading rapidly, social impact, sports restriction"
  - "Options: cryotherapy, curettage, cantharidin"
  - "Topical: imiquimod, tretinoin (off-label)"
  - "Avoid sharing towels, direct skin contact with lesions"
  - "Cover lesions for swimming, contact sports"
  - "Aggressive treatment may cause scarring"

disposition_guidance:
  - "Outpatient: All cases"
  - "Observation: Acceptable for limited, non-bothersome lesions"
  - "Dermatology referral: Extensive, facial, immunocompromised, treatment failure"
  - "Follow-up: As needed for treatment or progression"

parent_styles: [cosmetically-concerned, worried-about-spread, wanting-quick-fix]
