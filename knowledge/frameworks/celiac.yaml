# Celiac Disease - Teaching Framework
topic: "Celiac Disease"
aliases: ["celiac", "celiac sprue", "gluten intolerance"]
category: gi
age_range_months: [6, 216]

teaching_goals:
  - "Know who to screen and with what test"
  - "Recognize non-GI presentations"
  - "Understand testing requires gluten exposure"
  - "Counsel on lifelong gluten-free diet"

common_mistakes:
  - "Testing after patient has already started gluten-free diet"
  - "Using IgA TTG in IgA-deficient patient (false negative)"
  - "Missing non-GI presentations (anemia, short stature)"
  - "Not screening at-risk groups (Type 1 DM, Down syndrome)"

red_flags:
  - "Failure to thrive despite adequate intake"
  - "Severe anemia unresponsive to iron"
  - "Recurrent unexplained fractures (osteoporosis)"
  - "Dermatitis herpetiformis"

clinical_pearls:
  - "Screen with IgA TTG + total IgA (TTG may be falsely negative if IgA deficient)"
  - "Must be eating gluten for testing to be accurate - at least 2-4 weeks"
  - "Screen at-risk: Type 1 DM, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, family history"
  - "Non-GI presentations: Iron deficiency anemia, short stature, dental enamel defects, delayed puberty"
  - "Biopsy confirms diagnosis (though can skip if TTG very high + symptoms + EMA positive)"

key_history_questions:
  - "GI symptoms: Diarrhea, constipation, bloating, abdominal pain?"
  - "Growth concerns? Weight trajectory?"
  - "Anemia? Fatigue?"
  - "Family history of celiac or autoimmune diseases?"
  - "Age when gluten introduced?"
  - "Associated conditions (Type 1 DM, thyroid disease)?"
  - "Already on gluten-free diet? (Need to be eating gluten to test)"

key_exam_findings:
  - "Growth parameters - height, weight, BMI"
  - "Abdominal exam - distension"
  - "Signs of malnutrition"
  - "Pallor (anemia)"
  - "Dental enamel defects"
  - "Dermatitis herpetiformis (vesicular, pruritic, elbows/knees)"

treatment_principles:
  - "Lifelong strict gluten-free diet"
  - "GI referral for diagnosis confirmation and management"
  - "Dietitian consultation essential"
  - "Screen for nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, B12, folate)"
  - "Monitor: TTG for adherence, growth, associated conditions"
  - "Screen first-degree relatives"

disposition_guidance:
  - "GI referral: All suspected cases for biopsy confirmation"
  - "Dietitian: Essential for education on gluten-free diet"
  - "Screen siblings and parents"
  - "Follow-up: Monitor growth, adherence, screen for complications"

parent_styles: [overwhelmed-by-diet-change, skeptical, already-gluten-free]
